# 1. Introduction

`longquanagent` is a lightweight and flexible library designed for building smart agent assistants across various industries. Whether you're creating an AI-powered customer service bot, a data analysis assistant, or a domain-specific automation agent, longquanagent provides a simple yet powerful foundation.

With its modular tool system, you can easily extend your agent's capabilities by integrating a wide range of tools. Each tool is self-contained, well-documented, and can be registered dynamically—making it effortless to scale and adapt your agent to new tasks or environments.

To install and use this library please following two ways:

```
# Install via git clone
git clone git@github.com:datascienceworld-kan/longquanagent.git
cd longquanagent
pip install -r requirements.txt
poetry install
```

```
# Install via pip install
pip install longquanagent
```

To use a list of default tools inside [longquanagent.tools](longquanagent/tools/) you should set environment varibles inside `.env` including `TOGETHER_API_KEY` to use llm models at [togetherai](https://api.together.ai/signin) site and `TAVILY_API_KEY` to use tavily websearch tool at [tavily](https://app.tavily.com/home) site:

```
TOGETHER_API_KEY="Your together API key"
TAVILY_API_KEY="Your Tavily API key"
```
Let's create your acounts first and then create your relevant key for each website.

# 2. Set up Agent

`longquanagent` is a flexible library for creating intelligent agents. You can configure your agent with tools, each encapsulated in a Python module under `longquanagent.tools`. This provides a workspace of tools that agents can use to interact with and operate in the realistic world. Each tool is a Python file with full documentation and it can be independently ran. For example, the [longquanagent.tools.websearch_tools](longquanagent/tools/websearch_tools.py) module contains code for interacting with a search API.

Note: 
- Your python file only exist an unique main def function proceeding your task.
- Let's write the document for this main def function clearly. The good structure includes: Description (task description), Args (input arguments), and Returns (output result).
- If you have many sub-functions helping to run main function. Let's wrap up them inside a class.
- If you have many global def functions in a python module. All of them will be indexed a list of tools.

```python
from langchain_together import ChatTogether 
from longquanagent.agent.agent import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

llm = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
)

# Step 1: Create Agent with tools
agent = Agent(
    description="You are a Financial Analyst",
    llm = llm,
    skills = [
        "Deeply analyzing financial markets", 
        "Searching information about stock price",
        "Visualization about stock price"],
    tools = ['longquanagent.tools.websearch_tools',
             'longquanagent.tools.yfinance_tools']
)

# Step 2: invoke the agent
message = agent.invoke("Who you are?")
```

```
# Or you can pass absolute python file paths located on you local machine into tools
agent = Agent(
    description="You are a Financial Analyst",
    llm = llm,
    skills = [
        "Deeply analyzing financial markets", 
        "Searching information about stock price",
        "Visualization about stock price"],
    tools = ['/[Your_absolute_path]/websearch_tools.py',
             '/[Your_absolute_path]/yfinance_tools.py']
)
```

If the answer is a normal message without using any tools, it will be an `AIMessage`. By contrast, it will have `ToolMessage` type. For examples:

```
message
```
```
AIMessage(content='I am a Financial Analyst.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 7, 'prompt_tokens': 308, 'total_tokens': 315, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'model_name': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-070f7431-7176-42a8-ab47-ed83657c9463-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 308, 'output_tokens': 7, 'total_tokens': 315, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}})
```
Access to `content` property to get the string content.

```
message.content
```
```
I am a Financial Analyst.
```

The following function need to use yfinancial tool, therefore the return value will be `ToolMessage` with the a stored pandas.DataFrame in `artifact` property.

```
df = agent.invoke("What is the price of Tesla stock in 2024?")
df
```
```
ToolMessage(content="Completed executing tool fetch_stock_data({'symbol': 'TSLA', 'start_date': '2024-01-01', 'end_date': '2024-12-31', 'interval': '1d'})", tool_call_id='tool_cde0b895-260a-468f-ac01-7efdde19ccb7', artifact=pandas.DataFrame)
```

To access `pandas.DataFrame` value:

```
df.artifact.head()
```

![png](asset/table.png)

Another example, if you visualize a stock price using a tool, the output message is a `ToolMessage` with the saved `artifact` is a plotly plot.

```
# return a ToolMessage which we can access to plot by plot.artifact and content by plot.content.
plot = agent.invoke("Let's visualize Tesla stock in 2024?")
```

![png](asset/test_4_1.png)
    

```
# return a ToolMessage which we can access to plot by plot.artifact and content by plot.content.
plot = agent.invoke("Let's visualize the return of Tesla stock in 2024?")
```
  
![png](asset/return_plot.png)
    

# 3. Register function tool

Function tools are registered directly in your runtime code by decorating them with the @function_tool without saving them into python module files.


```python
agent = Agent(
    agent_name = "Sum Agent",
    description="You can sum a list",
    llm = setup_llm,
    skills = [
        "You can calculate a list and array of numbers",
    ],
    agent_template="agent_template/agent_template.json"
)

@agent.function_tool
def sum_of_series(x: List[float]):
    '''Sum of series
    Args:
        - x: List of numbers
    Returns:
        - Sum of series
    '''
    return f"Sum of list is {sum(x)}"
```
```
INFO:root:Registered tool: sum_of_series (runtime)
```

```python
message = agent.invoke("Sum of this list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]?")
message
```
```
ToolMessage(content="Completed executing tool sum_of_series({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]})", tool_call_id='tool_56f40902-33dc-45c6-83a7-27a96589d528', artifact='Sum of list is 55')
```

# 4. Advance Features

## 4.1. Deep Search

With longquanagent, you can invent a complex workflow by combining multiple tools into a single agent. This allows you to create a more sophisticated and flexible agent that can adapt to different task. Let's see how an agent can be created to help with financial analysis by using `deepsearch` tool, which allows you to search for information in a structured manner. This tool is particularly useful for tasks that require a deep understanding of the data and the ability to navigate through complex information.

```
from langchain_together import ChatTogether 
from longquanagent.agent.agent import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

llm = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
)

agent = Agent(
    description="You are a Financial Analyst",
    llm = llm,
    skills = [
        "Deeply analyzing financial markets", 
        "Searching information about stock price",
        "Visualization about stock price"],
    tools = ['longquanagent.tools.deepsearch']
)
    
message = agent.invoke("Let's analyze Tesla stock in 2025?")
print(message.artifact)
```

## 4.2. Trending Search

Exceptionally, longquanagent also offers a feature to summarize and highlight the top daily news on the internet based on any topic you are looking for, regardless of the language used. This is achieved by using the `trending_news` tool.

```
from langchain_together import ChatTogether 
from longquanagent.agent.agent import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

llm = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
)

agent = Agent(
    description="You are a Trending News Analyst",
    llm = llm,
    skills = [
        "Searching the trending news on realtime from google news",
        "Deeply analyzing top trending news"],
    tools = ['longquanagent.tools.trending_news']
)
    
message = agent.invoke("Tìm 5 tin tức nổi bật về tình hình giá vàng sáng hôm nay")
print(message.artifact)
```
