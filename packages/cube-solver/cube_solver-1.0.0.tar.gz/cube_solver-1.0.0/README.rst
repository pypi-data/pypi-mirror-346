Rubik's Cube Solver

* Free software: MIT License
* Documentation: https://cube-solver.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Command-line interface
* Transition and pruning tables
* Thistlethwaite solver algorithm


============
Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

To install **Cube Solver**, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install cube-solver

This is the preferred method to install **Cube Solver**, as it will always install the most recent stable release.


=====
Usage
=====

After installation, you can use the ``cube`` command straight away:

.. code-block:: console

    cube --help

To generate a scramble, use the ``scramble`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: console

    cube scramble

To solve a cube using the **Thistlethwaite** algorithm, use the ``solve`` subcommand.
The first time you solve a cube, it will generate the required tables, which takes around 5 minutes:

.. code-block:: console

    cube solve -r

To use **Cube Solver** in a Python project:

.. code-block:: python

    from cube_solver import Cube, Solver

    scramble = Cube.generate_scramble()
    print("Scramble:", scramble)

    cube = Cube(scramble)
    print(cube)

    solver = Solver(transition_tables=True, pruning_tables=True)
    solution = solver.thistlethwaite(cube)
    print("Solution:", solution)
