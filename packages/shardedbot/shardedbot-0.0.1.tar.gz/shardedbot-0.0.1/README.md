> documentation, features, and codebase are subject to change or removed.

>[!CAUTION]
>**Self-Hosting Sharded**
>***
> In the current state of development, self-hosting sharded is considered really difficult as many processes and systems
> aren't setup *(or closed testing),* so we ask to be patient if certain documentation isn't setup.
