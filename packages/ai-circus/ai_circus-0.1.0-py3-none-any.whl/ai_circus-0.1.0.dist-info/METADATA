## Setup

To properly set up your machine for development, follow these steps. These steps are designed for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems. Execute these commands in the root folder of the cloned project.

### One-Time Setup

1.  **Sudo Setup**:

    ```bash
    sudo ./.devcontainer/setup_sudo.sh
    ```

    This script configures `sudo` and installs essential base packages.

2.  **User Setup**:

    ```bash
    ./.devcontainer/setup_user.sh
    ```

    This script configures the user environment, installs `uv`, `cookiecutter`, and `pre-commit`, customizes the prompt, and sets up aliases.

3.  **Update Terminal**:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Apply the changes made by the user setup script to your current terminal session.

### Project Setup

After the one-time setup, use the `setup` macro to ensure the Python environment for the project is correctly recreated and synced.

```bash
setup
```

This command performs the following actions:

*   Checks and activates the virtual environment.
*   Syncs project dependencies using `uv`.

### Contributing

With the environment set up, you can use tools like `make` to contribute to the project.

*   **Quality Assurance**:

    ```bash
    make qa
    ```

    Runs quality assurance checks, including whitespace trimming, line ending fixes, TOML/YAML/JSON checks, merge conflict checks, Ruff, Pyright, and Bandit.
*   **Build**:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

    Executes the build process for the project.
