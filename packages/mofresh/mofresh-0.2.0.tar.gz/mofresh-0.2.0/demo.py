    ## `mofresh` demo

    The goal of this project is to offer a few tools that make it easy for you to refresh charts in marimo. This can be useful during a PyTorch training loop where you might want to update a chart on every iteration, but there are many other use-cases for this too. 

    ### How it works 

    The trick to get updating charts to work is to leverage [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev/). These widgets have a loop that is independant of the marimo cells which means that you can update a chart even if the cell hasn't completed running. The goal of this library is to make it easy to use this pattern by giving you a few utilities. 

    ### Updating `matplotlib` charts

    The easiest way to update matplotlib charts is to first write a function that can generate a chart. The most common way to use matplotlib is to use syntax like `plt.plot(...)` followed by a `plt.show(...)` and the best way to capture all of these layers is to wrap them all ina single function. Once you have such a function, you can use the `@refresh_matplotlib` decorator to turn this function into something that we can use in a refreshable-chart.

    ### Updating `altair` charts
