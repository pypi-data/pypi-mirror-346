This module implements the capability to keep activities that have been
completed, for future reporting, by setting them with the boolean
'Done'.

Since Odoo 18.0, this is supported natively by Odoo, depending on the
configuration of the activity types. This module ensures that the option is
active on all existing and new activity types in your setup.
