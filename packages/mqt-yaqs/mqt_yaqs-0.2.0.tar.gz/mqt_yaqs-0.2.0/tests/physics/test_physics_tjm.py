"""Tests for the Hamiltonian simulation with the Tensor Jump Method.

This module provides unit tests for the physics simulation functions implemented in the
PhysicsTJM module. It verifies that the initialization and time evolution routines for
the Tensor Jump Method (TJM) work as expected in various configurations, including both
first and second order evolution schemes, with and without timestep sampling.

The tests cover:
  - Initialization: Ensuring that a half time step of dissipation followed by a stochastic process
    is correctly applied to the initial state.
  - Step-through evolution: Verifying that dynamic_tdvp, apply_dissipation, and stochastic_process
    are called with the proper arguments during a single time step.
  - Physics simulation (order=2): Checking the shape of the results when running a second order evolution,
    with and without sampling timesteps.
  - Physics simulation (order=1): Checking the shape of the results when running a first order evolution,
    with and without sampling timesteps.

These tests ensure that the evolution functions correctly integrate the MPS state under the
specified Hamiltonian and noise model, and that observable measurements are properly aggregated.
