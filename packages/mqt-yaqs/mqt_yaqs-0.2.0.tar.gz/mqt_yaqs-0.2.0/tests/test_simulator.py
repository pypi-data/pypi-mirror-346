"""Tests for the simulator module in YAQS.

This module verifies the functionality of the simulator by testing both physics (Hamiltonian)
and circuit simulation branches. It includes tests for identity circuits, two-qubit operations,
long-range gate handling, weak and strong simulation modes, and error cases such as mismatched
qubit counts.
