"""Stochastic Process of the Tensor Jump Method.

This module implements stochastic processes for quantum systems represented as Matrix Product States (MPS).
It provides functions to compute the stochastic factor, generate a probability distribution for quantum jumps
based on a noise model, and perform a stochastic (quantum jump) process on the state. These tools are used
to simulate noise-induced evolution in quantum many-body systems.
