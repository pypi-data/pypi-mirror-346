# Wysebee

**Wysebee** is a cross-platform desktop application framework that enables developers to build modern, responsive user interfaces using web technologies â€” while leveraging the power of **PySide (Qt)** under the hood.

Wysebee is designed to simplify the development of desktop apps by combining the flexibility of HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontends with the robustness of Python and Qt on the backend.
