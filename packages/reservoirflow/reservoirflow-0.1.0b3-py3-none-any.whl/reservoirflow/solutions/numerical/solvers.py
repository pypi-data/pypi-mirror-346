=======

This module contains direct and iterative solvers to solve the system
of linear equations provided by numerical methods.

    """Returns an iterative solver (isolver).

    Iterative solvers for linear systems in sparse matrices using SciPy.
    Available iterative solvers are:

    .. code-block:: python

        isolvers = [
                "bicg",
                "bicgstab",

                "gcrotmk",
                "tfqmr",
            ]

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
        name of the iterative solver. If None, direct solver is used.
        Only relevant when argument sparse=True.
        Option "cgs" is recommended to increase performance while option
        "minres" is not recommended due to high MB error.
        For more information, check References section below.

    Returns
    -------
    isolver
        iterative solver for sparse matrices

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        isolver name is unknown.
