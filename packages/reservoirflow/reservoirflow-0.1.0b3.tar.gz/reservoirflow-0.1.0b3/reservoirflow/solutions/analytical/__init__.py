analytical
==========

This module provides specific analytical solutions for basic problems
where analytical solutions based on the continues form of :term:`PDE`
can be established. Usually, these problems are simpler and the 
analytical solution can be considered as an exact solution which can be 
used as a reference solution to evaluate and confirm other solutions (
e.g. ``numerical`` and ``neurical``) before these solutions are used in 
more complex problems.

Analytical solutions are a problem specific and the list below shows the
plan to work on these solutions in the future.

List of analytical solutions:
    * ``D1P1``: 1-Dimension-1-Phase
    * ``D1P2``: 1-Dimension-2-Phase (not available)
    * ``D1P3``: 1-Dimension-3-Phase (not available)
    * ``D2P1``: 2-Dimension-1-Phase (not available)
    * ``D2P2``: 2-Dimension-2-Phase (not available)
    * ``D2P3``: 2-Dimension-3-Phase (not available)
    * ``D3P1``: 3-Dimension-1-Phase (not available)
    * ``D3P2``: 3-Dimension-2-Phase (not available)
    * ``D3P3``: 3-Dimension-3-Phase (not available)

.. note::
    This list is rather a very optimistic one. For example, finding the 
    analytical for a ``D3P3`` might be impossible. However, constructing 
    a solution based on simpler cases (e.g. ``D1P3``) is a topic we
    would like to investigate.
