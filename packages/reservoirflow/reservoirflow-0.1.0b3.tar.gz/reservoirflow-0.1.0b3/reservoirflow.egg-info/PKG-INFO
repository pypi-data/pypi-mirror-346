             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially

          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights

        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.

               1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                  form), You must:
        
                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:

                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
             only;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
             terminate automatically.
        
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
             Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                  violation; or
        
               2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        
             For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
             right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
             of this Public License.
        
          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
             Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
             distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
             will not terminate this Public License.
        
          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
             License.
        
        
        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
        
          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
             terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        
          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
             Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
             independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
        
        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
        
          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
             shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
             conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
             be made without permission under this Public License.
        
          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
             deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
             minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
             cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
             without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
             conditions.

## Introduction

*ReservoirFlow* is a modern open-source Python library developed by [Zakariya Abugrin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakariya-abugrin/) at [Hiesab](https://www.hiesab.com/en/); a startup company specialized in advanced analytics, computing, and automation founded in 2024 with a mission is to accelerate R&D for AI applications and data solutions in different fields including Science, Engineering, and Education, see [About Us](https://reservoirflow.hiesab.com/about_us.html).

</p> -->

*ReservoirFlow* is designed to study and model the process of fluid flow in porous media related to subsurface energy storage systems, reservoir simulation and engineering. *ReservoirFlow* is the first reservoir simulator based on physics-informed neural network models and one of its kind in a sense that it allows comparing and combining analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and neurical solutions (i.e. solutions based on artificial neural networks). *ReservoirFlow* is planned to be a central platform between education and industry where scientific papers are implemented and distributed in a standard and accessible format with coding examples, tutorials, and trainings.

*ReservoirFlow* is designed based on the modern Python stack for data science, scientific computing, machine learning, and deep learning with the objective to support high-performance computing including multithreading, parallelism, GPU, and TPU. Throughout our computing problems based on large simulation models, intensive benchmarking well be carefully designed and carried out to evaluate the performance of computing software (i.e. frameworks) and hardware (e.g. GPUs). The outcome of these tests will be used to further improve the performance of *ReservoirFlow* and to provide materials with recommendations about available computing tools, techniques and frameworks. *ReservoirFlow* is planned to support different backends including [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and more.

*ReservoirFlow* brings reservoir simulation and engineering to the Python ecosystem to empower automation in intelligent fields where engineers and specialists can deploy their models in containers that will be ready to make real-time optimization for any well in the field. In contrast to commercial black-box software where reservoir simulation studies are relatively isolated, important actions can be immediately predicted and made available for the field hardware to execute. A special attention well be given to provide solutions for environmentally friendly projects with a clear objective to reduce emissions. We are committed to extend our tools to cover the topic of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) especially $CO_2$ Underground Storage. In addition, we are looking forward to covering a wider range of topics from Reservoir Engineering including: Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) and Rate Transient Analysis (RTA), Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), Improved Oil Recovery (IOR), Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT), Equation-of-State (EOS), etc.

*ReservoirFlow* aims to achieving a high quality open research for reservoir simulation and engineering to provide solutions that combine the strength of scientific computing with the power of deep learning for different applications such as: reverse computing, interpolation or extrapolation, etc. Below are few examples of the problems that will be tackled in the future:

- Real-time reservoir management and production optimization using Cloud Computing and IoT.
- Reinforcement learning to achieve better production strategies for specific goals (e.g. maximize recovery, accelerate production).
- History matching using machine learning.
- Advanced computing such as GPU, TPU and Quantum Computing.
- Scientific Machine learning using Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) or DeepONets.

An open-source reservoir simulation and engineering library within the Python ecosystem is also very important to students, universities, researchers, engineers, and practitioners. Unlike the common monopolistic approach in the Oil and Gas industry where software is usually offered as a closed black-box at a high cost, we plan to make our tools accessible and freely available to everyone except for commercial-use where an explicit authorization will be required. We aim to offer our sponsors the commercial-use license with other benefits including trainings, custom features, studies, and more. On the other hand, our license allows universities, students, academics, and researchers to use our tools directly for teaching or publication just with a proper referencing. Therefore, the growth of this tool can only be taken as a positive growth for a new community that we try to create. However, this requires a huge support to meet the upcoming challenges that we are looking for, see [Support Us](https://reservoirflow.hiesab.com/support_us.html).

## Installation

Install `reservoirflow` directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/reservoirflow/):

```console
$ pip install reservoirflow
```

For more information about the installation process, see: [Getting Started](https://reservoirflow.hiesab.com/user_guide/getting_started/getting_started.html) in the documentation.

## Import Convention

The following convention is used to import `reservoirflow` after installation:

```python
>>> import reservoirflow as rf
```

The abbreviation `rf` refers to `reservoirflow` where all modules under this library can be accessed. `rf` is also used throughout the documentation. We recommend our users to stick with this convention.
