;   Setup to make ASL build M80 .MAC files.
;
;   XXX This doesn't actually work since the macro syntax used by M80
;   is slightly different: it uses `&paramname` instead of just `paramname`
;   to substitute macro arguments. It's not clear how we might get around
;   this, except perhaps by pre-processing the file with sed. (There are
;   also probably many other things to be fixed.)
;
;   Test builds with `/opt/asl/bin/asl -x -i . 8080PRE.MAC  2>&1 | less`.
;   (Add a `-l` option to see the listing output to stdout as well.)
