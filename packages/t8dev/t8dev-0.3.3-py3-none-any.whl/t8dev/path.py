''' t8dev.path - Define path conventions and build paths

    Everything is relative to a project directory defined by the
    environment variable ``$T8_PROJDIR``, which must be an absolute path.
    Source code may be anywhere in or under the project directory; other
    files have specific locations defined in docstrings below for the
    functions that generate paths underneath these locations.

    Source code and data may be placed directly in $T8_PROJDIR but more
    often is under ``src/`` (libraries), ``exe/`` (complete executable
    programs) or other subdirectories.

    Subdirectories under ``$T8_PROJDIR/.build/`` include:
    • ``obj/``: Build output. Paths underneath this will match the path to
      the source code file relative to `$T8_PROJDIR`, e.g., ``src/foo/bar.a65``
      will produce output files ``.build/obj/src/foo/bar.*``.
    • ``tool/bin/``: Project-local binaries for tools used by this project.
      Executable files here will always be used if present, otherwise the
      usual $PATH search will occur.
