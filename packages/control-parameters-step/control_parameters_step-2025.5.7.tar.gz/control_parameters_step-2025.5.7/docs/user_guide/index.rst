The Control Parameters plug-in allows you to define parameters that control steps in the
flowchart, such as the temperature for dynamics. You can change these parameters when
you run the flowchart. From the command-line the parameters are added as arguments after
the flowchart. If submitting from the SEAMM GUI, there is a table of the parameters
where you can change their values.
