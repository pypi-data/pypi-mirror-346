# MT Message Type and Category Purpose Code Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the purpose code classifier to improve its accuracy when processing different SWIFT message types (MT103, MT202, MT202COV, MT205, MT205COV) and to reduce the usage of the generic 'OTHR' category purpose code.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Message Type Context Integration

The purpose code classifier now accepts an optional `message_type` parameter that provides context about the type of SWIFT message being processed. This context is used to enhance the prediction accuracy for interbank transfers and other specialized payment types.

```python
# Example usage
result = classifier.predict(narration, message_type="MT202")
```

### 2. Advanced Pattern Matching with Semantic Understanding

All domain enhancers have been updated to use advanced pattern matching with regular expressions and semantic understanding:

- **Regular Expression Patterns**: Uses word boundaries and case-insensitive matching for more accurate keyword detection
- **Semantic Understanding**: Identifies relationships between words in narrations (e.g., "payment for services" vs. just "services")
- **Pattern Prioritization**: Gives higher weight to semantic patterns than simple keyword matches
- **Message Type Awareness**: Applies different patterns based on the message type

### 3. Domain-Specific Enhancers Improvements

### 4. Category Purpose Code Enhancements

The category purpose code determination has been significantly improved to provide more accurate mappings from purpose codes to category purpose codes according to the ISO20022 standard:

- Direct mappings from purpose codes to category purpose codes
- Special case handling for supplier-related narrations (SUPP)
- Special case handling for fee collection (FCOL)
- Special case handling for utility bills (UBIL)
- Special case handling for insurance claims (INPC)
- Special case handling for government insurance (GOVI)
- Consistent mapping of services (SCVE) to supplier payments (SUPP)

- Consistent mapping of trade settlement (TRAD) to trade settlement (TRAD)
- Consistent mapping of customs payment (CUST) to customs payment (CUST)

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Explanation

All domain enhancers now include detailed logging and explanation of enhancement decisions:

- Logging of matched patterns and keywords
- Logging of confidence adjustments
- Logging of enhancement reasons
- Logging of category purpose code mappings
- Detailed explanation of why a particular enhancement was applied

### 6. OTHR Reduction Strategy

The domain enhancers have been updated with an aggressive strategy to reduce the usage of the generic 'OTHR' category purpose code:

- Extremely low thresholds for category relevance scores (down to 0.05)
- Automatic replacement of 'OTHR' with more specific category purpose codes
- Higher confidence scores for category purpose code predictions
- More weight given to category relevance scores in confidence calculations
- Always override 'OTHR' with a more specific category purpose code, even with low confidence
- Message type specific category purpose code mappings

### 7. Test Coverage

New test cases have been added to verify the enhancements:

- `test_message_type_enhancer.py`: Tests the message type enhancer with various message types
- `test_category_purpose_enhancer.py`: Tests the category purpose code determination

## Usage Guidelines

To leverage these enhancements, always provide the message type when calling the predict method:

```python
from purpose_classifier.lightgbm_classifier import LightGBMPurposeClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = LightGBMPurposeClassifier()

# Make a prediction with message type context
result = classifier.predict(
    narration="INTERBANK TRANSFER FOR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT",
    message_type="MT202"
)

# Access the results
purpose_code = result["purpose_code"]  # INTC
category_purpose_code = result["category_purpose_code"]  # INTC
confidence = result["confidence"]  # 0.98
category_confidence = result["category_confidence"]  # 0.95
```
