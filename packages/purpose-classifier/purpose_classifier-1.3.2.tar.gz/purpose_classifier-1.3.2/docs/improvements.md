# Purpose Code Classifier Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the purpose code classifier to address the identified areas for potential enhancement.

## 1. Education Classification Improvement

### Problem
The education payment was classified as SCVE (Purchase of Services) rather than EDUC (Education), even though the category purpose code was correctly mapped to FCOL.

### Solution
We implemented several enhancements to improve education classification:

1. **Enhanced Education Domain Enhancer**:
   - Added more education-specific keywords and patterns
   - Increased weights for education-related terms
   - Improved pattern matching for education-related narrations
   - Added more comprehensive combinations of education-related terms

2. **Improved Confidence Adjustment**:
   - More aggressive overriding for education-related narrations
   - Higher minimum confidence for education classifications
   - Special handling for service-related codes that might be education

3. **Additional Training Data**:
   - Created a script to generate education-specific training data
   - Diverse education-related narrations covering various scenarios
   - Proper mapping to EDUC purpose code and FCOL category purpose code

### Implementation
- Enhanced `education_enhancer.py` with improved detection capabilities
- Created `generate_education_training_data.py` to generate additional training data
- Updated confidence thresholds and scoring mechanisms

## 2. Top Predictions Diversity Improvement

### Problem
The top predictions showed relatively low confidence for alternatives, indicating the model might be overly confident in its primary prediction.

### Solution
We implemented confidence calibration and improved top predictions diversity:

1. **Confidence Calibration**:
   - Applied a sigmoid-like function to compress very high confidences
   - Adjusted confidence levels to avoid overconfidence
   - Maintained appropriate confidence for clear classifications

2. **Enhanced Top Predictions Diversity**:
   - Ensured at least 3 predictions in top predictions
   - Reduced confidence gaps between top predictions
   - Boosted alternative predictions when the primary prediction is very confident

3. **Improved Alternative Suggestions**:
   - Added more detailed information about alternative predictions
   - Included confidence scores for alternatives
   - Provided reasoning for alternative suggestions

### Implementation
- Created `improve_confidence_calibration.py` to update the model
- Modified the enhanced_predict function to improve confidence calibration
- Added mechanisms to ensure diverse top predictions

## 3. Processing Time Optimization

### Problem
While 2.4 seconds per classification is reasonable, optimization could potentially reduce this time for high-volume applications.

### Solution
We implemented several optimizations to improve processing time:

1. **Enhanced Caching Mechanism**:
   - Increased cache size from 1000 to 2000 entries
   - Added skip_preprocessing_for_cached option for faster cached lookups
   - Optimized cache key generation

2. **Fast Path Processing**:
   - Early exit for high-confidence predictions (>0.95)
   - Simplified processing for medium-high confidence predictions (0.7-0.95)
   - Optimized fallback rule application for low confidence predictions

3. **Batch Processing Optimizations**:
   - Set optimal batch size for vectorization (100)
   - Improved memory usage for batch processing
   - Reduced redundant operations in batch mode

### Implementation
- Created `optimize_processing_time.py` to update the model
- Modified the enhanced_predict function with fast paths
- Added optimization parameters to the model package

## Testing

We created a comprehensive testing script to evaluate the improvements:

1. **Education Classification Testing**:
   - Tests education-related narrations
   - Measures EDUC purpose code accuracy
   - Measures FCOL category purpose code accuracy

2. **Top Predictions Diversity Testing**:
   - Tests ambiguous narrations
   - Measures number of top predictions
   - Measures confidence gap between top predictions

3. **Processing Time Testing**:
   - Tests various types of narrations
   - Measures average processing time
   - Compares processing time for different enhancement types

### Implementation
- Created `test_improvements.py` to test all improvements
- Generates detailed CSV reports for each test
- Provides summary statistics for quick evaluation

## Usage

To apply these improvements, run the following scripts in order:

1. Generate additional education training data:
   ```
   python scripts/generate_education_training_data.py
   ```

2. Improve confidence calibration:
   ```
   python scripts/improve_confidence_calibration.py
   ```

3. Optimize processing time:
   ```
   python scripts/optimize_processing_time.py
   ```

4. Test the improvements:
   ```
   python scripts/test_improvements.py
   ```

## Expected Results

After applying these improvements, you should see:

1. **Education Classification**:
   - Higher accuracy for education-related narrations
   - Consistent mapping to FCOL category purpose code
   - Higher confidence for education classifications

2. **Top Predictions Diversity**:
   - More diverse top predictions
   - Smaller confidence gaps between predictions
   - Better alternative suggestions

3. **Processing Time**:
   - Reduced average processing time
   - Faster processing for high-confidence predictions
   - More efficient batch processing
