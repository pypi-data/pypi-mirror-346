import { VersionBadge } from "/snippets/version-badge.mdx"

The central piece of a FastMCP application is the `FastMCP` server class. This class acts as the main container for your application's tools, resources, and prompts, and manages communication with MCP clients.

## Creating a Server

Instantiating a server is straightforward. You typically provide a name for your server, which helps identify it in client applications or logs.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a basic server instance
mcp = FastMCP(name="MyAssistantServer")

# You can also add instructions for how to interact with the server
mcp_with_instructions = FastMCP(
    name="HelpfulAssistant",
    instructions="This server provides data analysis tools. Call get_average() to analyze numerical data."
)
```

The `FastMCP` constructor accepts several arguments:

*   `name`: (Optional) A human-readable name for your server. Defaults to "FastMCP".
*   `instructions`: (Optional) Description of how to interact with this server. These instructions help clients understand the server's purpose and available functionality.
*   `lifespan`: (Optional) An async context manager function for server startup and shutdown logic.
*   `tags`: (Optional) A set of strings to tag the server itself.
*   `**settings`: Keyword arguments corresponding to additional `ServerSettings` configuration

## Components

FastMCP servers expose several types of components to the client:

### Tools

Tools are functions that the client can call to perform actions or access external systems.

```python
@mcp.tool()
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiplies two numbers together."""
    return a * b
```

See [Tools](/servers/tools) for detailed documentation.

### Resources

Resources expose data sources that the client can read.

```python
@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> dict:
    """Provides the application configuration."""
    return {"theme": "dark", "version": "1.0"}
```

See [Resources & Templates](/servers/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Resource Templates

Resource templates are parameterized resources that allow the client to request specific data.

```python
@mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
def get_user_profile(user_id: int) -> dict:
    """Retrieves a user's profile by ID."""
    # The {user_id} in the URI is extracted and passed to this function
    return {"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}", "status": "active"}
```

See [Resources & Templates](/servers/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable message templates for guiding the LLM.

```python
@mcp.prompt()
def analyze_data(data_points: list[float]) -> str:
    """Creates a prompt asking for analysis of numerical data."""
    formatted_data = ", ".join(str(point) for point in data_points)
    return f"Please analyze these data points: {formatted_data}"
```

See [Prompts](/servers/prompts) for detailed documentation.

## Running the Server

FastMCP servers need a transport mechanism to communicate with clients. In the MCP protocol, servers typically run as separate processes that clients connect to.

### The `__main__` Block Pattern

The standard way to make your server executable is to include a `run()` call inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

```python
# my_server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This code only runs when the file is executed directly
    
    # Basic run with default settings (stdio transport)
    mcp.run()
    
    # Or with specific transport and parameters
    # mcp.run(transport="sse", host="127.0.0.1", port=9000)
```

This pattern is important because:

1. **Client Compatibility**: Standard MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) expect to execute your server file directly with `python my_server.py`
2. **Process Isolation**: Each server runs in its own process, allowing clients to manage multiple servers independently
3. **Import Safety**: The main block prevents the server from running when the file is imported by other code

While this pattern is technically optional when using FastMCP's CLI, it's considered a best practice for maximum compatibility with all MCP clients.

### Transport Options

FastMCP supports two transport mechanisms:

#### STDIO Transport (Default)

The standard input/output (STDIO) transport is the default and most widely compatible option:

```python
# Run with stdio (default)
mcp.run()  # or explicitly: mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

With STDIO:
- The client starts a new server process for each session
- Communication happens through standard input/output streams
- The server process terminates when the client disconnects
- This is ideal for integrations with tools like Claude Desktop, where each conversation gets its own server instance

#### SSE Transport (Server-Sent Events)

For long-running servers that serve multiple clients, FastMCP supports SSE:

```python
# Run with SSE on default host/port (0.0.0.0:8000)
mcp.run(transport="sse")
```

With SSE:
- The server runs as a persistent web server
- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- The server stays running until explicitly terminated
- This is ideal for remote access to services

You can configure transport parameters directly when running the server:

```python
# Configure with specific parameters
mcp.run(
    transport="sse", 
    host="127.0.0.1",  # Override default host
    port=8888,         # Override default port
    log_level="debug"  # Set logging level
)

# You can also run asynchronously with the same parameters
import asyncio
asyncio.run(
    mcp.run_sse_async(
        host="127.0.0.1", 
        port=8888, 
        log_level="debug"
    )
)
```

Transport parameters passed to `run()` or `run_sse_async()` override any settings defined when creating the FastMCP instance. The most common parameters for SSE transport are:

- `host`: Host to bind to (default: "0.0.0.0")
- `port`: Port to bind to (default: 8000)
- `log_level`: Logging level (default: "INFO")

#### Advanced Transport Configuration

Under the hood, FastMCP's `run()` method accepts arbitrary keyword arguments (`**transport_kwargs`) that are passed to the transport-specific run methods:

```python
# For SSE transport, kwargs are passed to run_sse_async()
mcp.run(transport="sse", **transport_kwargs)

# For stdio transport, kwargs are passed to run_stdio_async()
mcp.run(transport="stdio", **transport_kwargs)
```

This means that any future transport-specific options will be automatically available through the same interface without requiring changes to your code.

### Using the FastMCP CLI

The FastMCP CLI provides a convenient way to run servers:

```bash
# Run a server (defaults to stdio transport)
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp

# Explicitly specify a transport
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp --transport sse

# Configure SSE transport with host and port
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp --transport sse --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888

# With log level
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp --transport sse --log-level DEBUG
```

The CLI can dynamically find and run FastMCP server objects in your files, but including the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures compatibility with all clients.

## Composing Servers

<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

FastMCP supports composing multiple servers together using `import_server` (static copy) and `mount` (live link). This allows you to organize large applications into modular components or reuse existing servers.

See the [Server Composition](/patterns/composition) guide for full details, best practices, and examples.

```python
# Example: Importing a subserver
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

main = FastMCP(name="Main")
sub = FastMCP(name="Sub")

@sub.tool()
def hello(): 
    return "hi"

# Mount directly
main.mount("sub", sub)
```

## Proxying Servers

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

FastMCP can act as a proxy for any MCP server (local or remote) using `FastMCP.from_client`, letting you bridge transports or add a frontend to existing servers. For example, you can expose a remote SSE server locally via stdio, or vice versa.

See the [Proxying Servers](/patterns/proxy) guide for details and advanced usage.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

backend = Client("http://example.com/mcp/sse")
proxy = FastMCP.from_client(backend, name="ProxyServer")
# Now use the proxy like any FastMCP server
```

## Server Configuration

Server behavior, like transport settings (host, port for SSE) and how duplicate components are handled, can be configured via `ServerSettings`. These settings can be passed during `FastMCP` initialization, set via environment variables (prefixed with `FASTMCP_SERVER_`), or loaded from a `.env` file.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Configure during initialization
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="ConfiguredServer",
    port=8080, # Directly maps to ServerSettings
    on_duplicate_tools="error" # Set duplicate handling
)

# Settings are accessible via mcp.settings
print(mcp.settings.port) # Output: 8080
print(mcp.settings.on_duplicate_tools) # Output: "error"
```

### Key Configuration Options

- **`host`**: Host address for SSE transport (default: "0.0.0.0")
- **`port`**: Port number for SSE transport (default: 8000)
- **`log_level`**: Logging level (default: "INFO")
- **`on_duplicate_tools`**: How to handle duplicate tool registrations
- **`on_duplicate_resources`**: How to handle duplicate resource registrations
- **`on_duplicate_prompts`**: How to handle duplicate prompt registrations

All of these can be configured directly as parameters when creating the `FastMCP` instance.

### Custom Tool Serialization

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

By default, FastMCP serializes tool return values to JSON when they need to be converted to text. You can customize this behavior by providing a `tool_serializer` function when creating your server:

```python
import yaml
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Define a custom serializer that formats dictionaries as YAML
def yaml_serializer(data):
    return yaml.dump(data, sort_keys=False)

# Create a server with the custom serializer
mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", tool_serializer=yaml_serializer)

@mcp.tool()
def get_config():
    """Returns configuration in YAML format."""
    return {"api_key": "abc123", "debug": True, "rate_limit": 100}
```

The serializer function takes any data object and returns a string representation. This is applied to **all non-string return values** from your tools. Tools that already return strings bypass the serializer.

This customization is useful when you want to:
- Format data in a specific way (like YAML or custom formats)
- Control specific serialization options (like indentation or sorting)
- Add metadata or transform data before sending it to clients

<Tip>
If the serializer function raises an exception, the tool will fall back to the default JSON serialization to avoid breaking the server.
</Tip>

## Authentication

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

FastMCP inherits support for OAuth 2.0 authentication from the MCP protocol, allowing servers to protect their tools and resources behind authentication.

### OAuth 2.0 Support

The `mcp.server.auth` module implements an OAuth 2.0 server interface that servers can use by providing an implementation of the `OAuthServerProvider` protocol.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.server.auth.settings import (
    RevocationOptions,
    ClientRegistrationOptions,
    AuthSettings,
)


# Create a server with authentication
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="SecureApp",
    auth_provider=MyOAuthServerProvider(),
    auth=AuthSettings(
        issuer_url="https://myapp.com",
        revocation_options=RevocationOptions(
            enabled=True,
        ),
        client_registration_options=ClientRegistrationOptions(
            enabled=True,
            valid_scopes=["myscope", "myotherscope"],
            default_scopes=["myscope"],
        ),
        required_scopes=["myscope"],
    ),
)
```
