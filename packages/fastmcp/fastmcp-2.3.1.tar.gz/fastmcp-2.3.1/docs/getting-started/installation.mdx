## Install FastMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FastMCP.

If you plan to use FastMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:

```bash
uv add fastmcp
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:
<CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install fastmcp
    ```

    ```bash pip
    pip install fastmcp
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

To verify that FastMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
fastmcp version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
$ fastmcp version

FastMCP version:   0.4.2.dev41+ga077727.d20250410
MCP version:                                1.6.0
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FastMCP root path:            ~/Developer/fastmcp
```
## Upgrading from the Official MCP SDK

Upgrading from the official MCP SDK's FastMCP 1.0 to FastMCP 2.0 is easy! The core server API is highly compatible, so after you install the `fastmcp` package, just change your import statement from `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP`. 


```python {1-5}
# Before
# from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# After
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
```

While the 1.0 server API is very stable for common use cases, FastMCP 2.0 introduces many new features (like the Client, proxying, composition) documented throughout this site. Review the documentation for details on new capabilities.

## Installing for Development

If you plan to contribute to FastMCP, you should begin by cloning the repository and using uv to install all dependencies (development dependencies are installed automatically):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp.git
cd fastmcp
uv sync
```

This will install all dependencies, including ones for development, and create a virtual environment, which you can activate and use as normal.

### Unit Tests

FastMCP has a comprehensive unit test suite, and all PR's must introduce and pass appropriate tests. To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

FastMCP uses pre-commit to manage code quality, including formatting, linting, and type-safety. All PRs must pass the pre-commit hooks, which are run as a part of the CI process. To install the pre-commit hooks, run:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

Alternatively, to run pre-commit manually at any time, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
