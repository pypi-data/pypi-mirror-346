Notes
-----
<ul>
  <li>Due to rate limiting implemented by the SSC web services, an
      attempt to make simultaneous requests from many threads is likely
      to actually reduce performance. At this time, it is best to make
      calls from five or fewer threads.</li>
  <li>This library does not currently implement the /graphs
      resources.  If there is interest in this, support could be added
      in the future.</li>
  <li>The core functionality is implemented in the `sscws.sscws`
      sub-module.  New users should start by viewing the `sscws.sscws`
      sub-module.</li>
