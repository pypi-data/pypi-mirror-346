Lisp and Python should love each other. Let's make it happen.

Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python. Since Hy transforms its Lisp
code into Python abstract syntax tree (AST) objects, you have the whole
beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form.

To install the latest release of Hy, just use the command `pip3 install
--user hy`. Then you can start an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) with
the command `hy`, or run a Hy program with `hy myprogram.hy`.
