### [Solving the Document Context Problem for AI with ContextFrame](solving-context-problem.md)

*February 28, 2024*

In today's AI ecosystem, one of the most significant challenges is maintaining document context and relationships. When documents are processed by Large Language Models (LLMs), crucial information about their purpose, origin, and relationships to other documents is often lost.
