# Zenif 0.5.2

Zenif (pronounced "Zenith") is a Python library designed to enhance the way you write your code. Please take it into consideration that I developed Zenif as a personal side-project of mine to help me with other projects, so some features might not work as expected as I have not full tested everything.

## Installation

Zenif requires Python 3.12 or higher. To install the latest version, install with `pip` or your favorite PyPi package manager.

```sh
pip install zenif
```

This command will download and install Zenif along with its dependencies.

## Documentation

### Modules

- [Log](https://github.com/DomBom16/zenif/blob/main/docs/modules/log.md): Enhance your debugging game with a highly customizable logger
- [Decorators](https://github.com/DomBom16/zenif/blob/main/docs/modules/decorators.md): Give your functions extra functionality on the fly
- [Schema](https://github.com/DomBom16/zenif/blob/main/docs/modules/schema.md): Validate your user's inputs with intuitive syntax
