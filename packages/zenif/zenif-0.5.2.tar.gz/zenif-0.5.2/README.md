# Zenif 0.5.2

Zenif (pronounced "Zenith") is a Python library designed to enhance the way you write your code. Please take it into consideration that I developed Zenif as a personal side-project of mine to help me with other projects, so some features might not work as expected as I have not full tested everything.

## Installation

Zenif requires Python 3.12 or higher. To install the latest version, install with `pip` or your favorite PyPi package manager.

```sh
pip install zenif
```

This command will download and install Zenif along with its dependencies.
