# Huawei Solar Tools

**Huawei Solar Tools** is a Python library for interacting with **Huawei solar inverters, batteries, power meters, and energy management interfaces (EMI)** using **Modbus TCP**.

It provides methods to read and write Modbus registers, retrieve operational data, and interpret register values.

## Functionality
- Establishes **Modbus TCP** communication with Huawei solar devices.
- Reads and writes **Modbus registers**.
- Retrieves device status, operational parameters, and alarms.
- Converts raw register values into structured data.
- Supports multiple devices in parallel.

## Target Users
- **Developers** integrating Huawei solar devices into software systems.
- **System administrators** managing solar installations.
- **Data engineers** handling time-series data from Huawei devices.

## Features

### üì° Communication
- Modbus TCP client for interacting with Huawei solar equipment.
- Multi-device support.

### üîç Data Retrieval
- Reads **real-time data** from inverters, batteries, and meters.
- Fetches **system status, alarms, and operational parameters**.
- Reads **raw registers** and interprets their values.

### üîß Register Processing
- Decodes **bitfields, integers, floats, and string registers**.
- Converts raw **Modbus register values** into structured formats.

### üìä Database Integration (User Implementation)
- Compatible with **ClickHouse** and **InfluxDB** for data storage (not required for core library).


## Installation

Huawei Solar Tools requires **Python 3.9+**.

## Usage

The following examples demonstrate how to use the **Huawei Solar Tools** library for basic interactions.  
For more detailed examples, refer to the scripts in the `tests/` directory.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize a Connection to a Huawei Inverter

```python
from huawei_solar_tools.devices.inverter import Inverter

# Define connection parameters
host = "192.168.1.100"
port = 502
device_id = 1

# Initialize the inverter
inverter = Inverter(host, port, device_id)

async def main():
    await inverter.connect()
    print(f"Device ID: {inverter.get_device_id()}")
    print("All Registers:", await inverter.read_all_registers())
    await inverter.disconnect()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```
