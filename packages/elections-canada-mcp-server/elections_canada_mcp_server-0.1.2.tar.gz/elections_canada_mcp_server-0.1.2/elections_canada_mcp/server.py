Elections Canada MCP Server

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides access to Canadian federal election data from 2021.
The server exposes resources and tools to query and analyze election results by riding, province, and party.

This is a project of ThreeFortyThree Canada (https://threefortythree.ca).

Available tools:
- search_ridings: Search for ridings by name (accent-insensitive)
- get_party_votes: Get vote distribution for a party in a riding
- get_winning_party: Get the party that won a specific riding
- summarize_province_results: Summarize election results for a province
- summarize_national_results: Summarize national election results
- find_closest_ridings: Find the closest ridings by vote margin
- best_and_worst_results: Get best and worst results for a party
