# Elections Canada MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Canadian federal election data. It currently supports results from the 2021 and 2025 elections. Future updates will include past elections, census demographics, and ThreeFortyThree real-time projections.

Brought to you by [ThreeFortyThree](https://threefortythree.ca), this server powers [ThreeFortyThree Chat](https://threefortythree.ca/chat) and is available for use with MCP clients such as Claude Desktop.

## 🛠 Setup

### Installation (via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/elections-canada-mcp-server/))

```bash
uv pip install elections-canada-mcp-server
```

---

### Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Make sure the server is installed:

```bash
uv pip install elections-canada-mcp-server
```

2. Open your `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following block:

#### uv

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elections_canada_data_and_predictions": {
      "command": "{PATH_TO_UVX}",  // Replace with output of: which uvx
      "args": ["elections-canada-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. Now you can ask Claude questions such as:
   - "What were the 2021 election results in Toronto Centre?"
   - "Which ridings were closest for the NDP?"
   - "Show me the highest-margin wins for the Conservatives in 2021."

### Local Development

To test the server using [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThreeFortyThree-Canada/elections-canada-mcp-server.git
   cd elections-canada-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install MCP CLI:
   ```bash
   uv pip install mcp
   ```

3. Test the server:
   ```bash
   mcp dev elections_canada_mcp/server.py
   ```

This opens a web UI to test the server locally.
