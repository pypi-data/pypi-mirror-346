# Elections Canada MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Canadian federal election data. It currently supports results from the 2021 election, redistributed to the 2023 riding boundaries. Future updates will include past elections, census demographics, and real-time projections.

Brought to you by [ThreeFortyThree](https://threefortythree.ca), this server powers [ThreeFortyThree Chat](https://threefortythree.ca/chat) and is available for use with local models via Claude Desktop.
