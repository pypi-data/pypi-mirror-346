"""
The propositional class for defining a derivation and system should work here without modification.
Hence, this module only exists to make imports prettier, i.e. so that instead of

>>> from logics.classes.propositional.proof_theories.derivation.Derivation

we can write

>>> from logics.classes.predicate.proof_theories.derivation.Derivation
"""
from logics.classes.propositional.proof_theories import Derivation
