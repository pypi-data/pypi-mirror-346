# Shellviz Python Library

Shellviz is a zero-hassle Python tool that transforms your data into dynamic, real-time visualizations you can explore right in your browser. It's lightweight, free, and has no dependencies ‚Äî just install and start visualizing!

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Install Shellviz with pip:

```bash
pip install shellviz
```

# üîß Getting Started

## Basic Usage
```python
from shellviz import log, table, json

log('my first shellviz command')
# Shellviz serving on http://127.0.0.1:5544

table([("Alice", 25, 5.6), ("Bob", 30, 5.9)])
json({"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 5.6})
```
Open the generated URL in your browser, and you‚Äôll see your data visualized instantly.

## Advanced Usage

**Update Existing Values**
```python
from shellviz import progress
progress(0.0, id='migration')
progress(1.0, id='migration') # Update data dynamically
```

# Django Integration

## Querysets and Models

Shellviz can encode Queryset and Model instances, so you can visualize ORM queries without having to serialize them

```python
from shellviz import json, card
json(request.user)
card(User.objects.all())
```

## Django Logging

Shellviz has an optional drop-in logging handler that can automatically initialize a Shellviz instance and forward all `logging` calls to it

```python
LOGGING = {
    'handlers': {
        'shellviz': {
            'class': 'shellviz.django_logging.ShellvizHandler',
            #...
        },
    }
}
```

## Django Debug Toolbar

Shellviz can be configured to launch as a tab in the Django Debug Toolbar

```python
DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = [
    #...
    'shellviz.django_debug_toolbar.ShellvizPanel'
    #...
]
```

# Build
Bundling and deploying Shellviz is straightforward. Run the following command to build a compiled version of the Shellviz client that will be placed in the package's `build` folder:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

Once this is done, you can compile the package using poetry:
```bash
cd libraries/python
poetry build
```
To install into a local python environment, run the following command:

```bash
poetry add --no-cache ~/[path-to-repo]/dist/shellviz-0.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```
