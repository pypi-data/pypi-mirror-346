# AI Interaction via Customizable Prompts
This Python project allows users to interact with a powerful AI model in a personalized and efficient manner. By tailoring your inputs, you
can receive highly relevant and accurate responses based on your unique context.
## Features
- **Personalized AI Responses**: Adjust the AI's responses based on your individual profile or preferences. With the ability to set a custom description, the
AI can tailor its answers to be more relevant and precise.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate the AI service into your Python projects with just a few simple functions. No need for complex setups or configurations.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Send queries to the AI and receive prompt responses directly, making it ideal for a variety of use cases from casual conversations
to technical questions.
## How It Works
### Key Functions
- **personalization(desc)**
This function allows you to set a custom description that will be used to personalize the AI's response. By defining your preferences or introducing specific
context, the AI can provide more tailored answers.
**Input**: `desc` (string) — Your personal context or description.
**Output**: None (sets a global variable that will be used in subsequent prompts).
- **prompt(message)**
This function sends your message to the AI and returns its response. If a description is set, it will be included to make the AI's answer more relevant.
**Input**: `message` (string) — The message you want to send to the AI.
**Output**: (string) — The filtered and tailored response from the AI.
### Example Usage
```python
import chatbotlib
chatbotlib.personalization("I am a software developer with a strong interest in artificial intelligence.")
response = chatbotlib.prompt("What is your opinion on the future of AI in programming?")
print(response)
```
## How It Benefits You
- **Customized Results**: The ability to personalize the AI ensures that the responses you receive are tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're a developer,
student, or enthusiast, the AI will adjust its answers to match your context.
- **No Unnecessary Responses**: By defining a personalized context, you avoid unnecessary or generic responses, making the conversation feel more natural and relevant.
- **Versatility**: The system can be used for a wide range of applications, from personal inquiries to technical problem-solving, making it a versatile tool
for anyone looking to interact with AI.
## Dependencies
- **requests**: A simple HTTP library for sending requests to external services.
- **beautifulsoup4**: A library for parsing and handling HTML responses efficiently.
## Getting Started
1. **Install the dependencies**: Use pip to install the necessary libraries.
2. **Set a Personal Description**: Customize your experience by providing a description of yourself or your preferences using the `personalization()` function.
3. **Send a Message**: Use the `prompt()` function to send your message to the AI and receive a response.
## Example Scenario
Imagine you are working on a coding project and need quick, relevant advice. Instead of receiving generic responses, you provide a description of your project,
and the AI will respond with insights tailored specifically to your needs, making your interactions with AI smarter and more productive.
## Troubleshooting
- **Error Handling**: If the AI service fails to respond or returns unexpected results, ensure your internet connection is active and the service is available.
Check the response codes and logs for detailed troubleshooting.
- **Response Quality**: The quality of responses depends heavily on the context provided. The more detailed and specific your personalization, the more relevant
the AI’s answers will be.
