# Getting Help

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Before seeking external help, check the following:

### Check the Logs

RA.Aid maintains detailed logs that can help diagnose many common issues. By default, logs are stored in the `.ra-aid/logs/` directory in your working directory.

1. Check the most recent log file in `.ra-aid/logs/` directory
2. Look for ERROR or WARNING level messages that might indicate what went wrong
3. For more detailed logging options, see the [Logging documentation](/configuration/logging)

### Common Problems

- **Error connecting to API**: Verify your API key is set correctly
- **Command not found**: Ensure RA.Aid is installed properly and in your PATH
- **Script execution failures**: Check that required dependencies are installed
