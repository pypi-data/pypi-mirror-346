**SEAM** (**S**ystematic **E**xplanation of **A**ttribution-based for **M**echanisms) is a Python suite to use meta-explanations to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data. For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the SEAM website, https://seam-nn.readthedocs.io/.

For an extended discussion of this approach and its applications, please refer to our manuscript, which we presented at the [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/) [GEM Workshop](https://www.gembio.ai/):

Decoding the Mechanistic Impact of Genetic Variation on Regulatory Sequences with Deep Learning. *Workshop on Generative and Experimental Perspectives for Biomolecular Design*, *International Conference on Learning Representations*, April 15, 2025. https://openreview.net/forum?id=PtjMeyHcTt

A bioRxiv preprint is also currently underway.

## Installation:

With [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) sourced, create a new environment via the command line:

```bash
conda create --name seam
```

Next, activate this environment via `conda activate seam`, and install the following packages:

```bash
pip install seam-nn
```

Finally, when you are done using the environment, always exit via `conda deactivate`.


### Notes

SEAM has been tested on Mac and Linux operating systems. Typical installation time on a normal computer is less than 1 minute.

If you have any issues installing SEAM, please see:
- https://seam-nn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- https://github.com/evanseitz/seam-nn/issues

For issues installing SQUID, the package used for sequence generation and inference, please see:
- https://squid-nn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- https://github.com/evanseitz/squid-nn/issues

Older DNNs that require inference via Tensorflow 1.x or related packages may be in conflict with SEAM defaults. Users will need to run SEAM piecewise within separate environments:
1. Tensorflow 1.x environment for generating *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset
2. Tensorflow 2.x environment for applying SEAM to explain *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset

## Usage:
SEAM provides a simple interface that takes as input a sequence-based oracle (e.g., a genomic DNN), which is used to generate an *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset representing a localized region of sequence space. SEAM uses a meta-explanation framework to interpret the *in silico* sequence-function-mechanism dataset, deciphering the determinants of mechanistic variation in regulatory sequences.

### Examples

**Google Colab examples** for applying SEAM on previously-published deep learning models are available at the links below.

> Note: Due to memory requirements for calculating distance matrices, Colab Pro may be required for examples using hierarchical clustering with their current settings.

**Python script examples** are provided in the `examples` folder for locally running SEAM and exporting outputs to file. Additional dependencies for these examples may be required and outlined at the top of each script.

## SEAM Interactive Interpretability Tool:
A graphic user interface (GUI) is available for dynamically interpretting SEAM results. The GUI can be run using the command line interface from the `seam` folder via `python seam_gui.py`. The SEAM GUI requires pre-computed inputs that can be saved using the example scripts above.
