# iQore SDK (Coming Soon)

> 🔒 Secure. Optimized. Hybrid. The future of quantum-classical computing begins here.

This SDK reserves the official `iQore` namespace and serves as a placeholder for the forthcoming **iQore Quantum Optimization Stack (iQD)** — a proprietary circuit enhancement layer built to accelerate quantum workloads across all sectors.

---

## 🔧 What is iQD?

The `iQD` Engine is a deterministic optimizer that:

* 📡 **Injects custom gate logic** into user circuits — boosting fidelity, entanglement depth, and resilience
* 🧠 **Applies dynamic tensor control** to adapt circuits to backend-specific noise models

---

## 🔌 How It Will Work

Once launched, developers will be able to:

1. **Install the SDK**

   ```bash
   pip install iqore
   ```

2. **Authenticate using a secure token**

3. **Optimize any Qiskit-compatible circuit**

   ```python
   from iQore import iQD

   qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
   qc.h(0)
   qc.cx(0, 1)

   iQD.optimize(qc, backend=backend, matrix=entropy_map)
   ```

---

## 🚀 Planned Features in v0.1.0

* 🔄 Local token validation and license enforcement
* 📡 Encrypted remote execution of circuit optimization
* 🧬 Fidelity-aware gate restructuring (iQD core)
* 📊 Optional metrics reporting (TVD, coherence score, entanglement ratio)
* 🔐 Tiered feature access (free, pro, enterprise)

---

## 📌 Why This Placeholder Exists

This version contains no operational functionality and is not yet connected to iQore’s secure backend systems. It is published to:

* Reserve the global `iQore` namespace on PyPI
* Finalize packaging, build, and import conventions
* Provide early visibility into the upcoming SDK

> 🛠️ The production-grade optimizer and backend API are currently under development.
