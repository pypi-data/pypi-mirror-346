Non-inverting Amplifier
========================

This experiment is very similar to the previous one, the inverting amplifier.

Objective
---------

Wire an non-inverting amplifier using an Op-Amp, like ÂµA741 or OP07,  and test it.

Procedure
---------

-  Make the connections on bread board as shown in the figure.
-  Set WG amplitude to 80 mV and frequency to 1000 Hz
-  Enable A1 and A2, and set ranges to 1V
-  Enable the amplitude and frequency displays of A1 and A2.
-  Make connections and calculate the voltage gain from the output
-  Change gain by changing the resistor values.

The amplitude gain and and the phase difference can be observed from the output below.

Discussion
----------

Using expEYES, it is not possible to study the high frequency response.
