           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

# DBIS Relational Calculus

[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/dbis-relational-calculus)](https://pypi.org/project/dbis-relational-calculus/)
[![PyPI Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dbis-relational-calculus)](https://pypi.org/project/dbis-relational-calculus/)

This set of classes is used to define objects of the relational model (as a result of a conversion from an ER-diagram)

# Features
- Create expressions of tuple and domain calculus in python.
- Validate these expressions on a basic level.
- Convert these expressions to Text in LaTeX math mode.
- Convert these expressions to queries in SQLite.

# Installation
Install via pip:
```sh
pip install dbis-relational-calculus
```

# Basic usage
Both tuple and domain calculus were developed to be as similar as possible to each other, and to the mathematical notation. You will find, that the programming style between tuple and domain calculus is in most ways identically.

The only difference between both stems from what variables express in each of the relational calculus notations:
 - In the tuple calculus, a variable represents a tuple of a relation (i.e. a row). Therefore, we here have to define the relation (type), which the variable stems from ($`x \in R`$).
 - In the domain calculus, a variable represents an entry of a relation in a specific column. Multiple variables combined make up for a whole tuple in a specific relation ($`R(x, y, z)`$).

## Specific usages
### Tuple Calculus
#### Atoms
The comparison operators can be used to bound/set the values of a variables attribute, or compare two different variables attributes. We can access the attributes of a variable in two ways: Either as a `tuple[Variable, str]` or using the `__getitem__` syntax. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:
```python
assert var["some_attribute"] == (var, "some_attribute")
```
```python
eq = Equals((x, 'some_attribute'), "Hello!")
gt = GreaterThan(5, y['other_attribute'])
le = LessEquals((z, 'other_attribute'), 7.2)
lt = LessThan(a['some_attribute'], (b, 'other_attribute'))
```
Since a variable being returned cannot be quantified, we still must somehow tell the formula, which relation the variable stems from. For this reason, `Variable` is also an atom in the tuple calculus. See the examples down below.
```python
x = Variable('x', 'some_relation')
```

#### Quantifiers
When a variable is not being returned, it has to be quantified. This is done by using the `Forall` and `Exists` construct. `sub_formula` here refers to a formula generated by using other atoms, quantifiers, and connectives.
```python
forall = Forall(x, sub_formula)
exists = Exists(x, sub_formula)
```
If one wants to quantify multiple variables using the same quantification type at once, one can do so efficiently by using sets:
```python
foralls = Forall({x,y,z}, sub_formula)
exists = Exists({x,y,z}, sub_formula)
```

#### Connectives
The connectives can be used to combine atoms, quantifiers, and connectives.
```python
and_formula = And(sub_formula_1, sub_formula_2)
or_formula = Or(sub_formula_1, sub_formula_2)
not_formula = Not(sub_formula)
```

#### Examples
##### Example 1
- Relation `People` has three attributes: `name`, `age`, and `height`.
```python
from relational_calculus.tuple_calculus import *

# define the variable used
p = Variable('p', 'People')

# define the expression
tc = TupleCalculus(
	# return every attribute of p
	Result([p]),
	# attribute height of p has to be greater than 190
	And(
		p,
		GreaterThan(p['height'], 190)
	)
)

# check if the expression is valid
is_correct = tc.verify()

# get latex math mode string representation
latex = str(tc)

# convert the expression into an SQLite query
query = tc.to_sql()
```
`tc` will now return every attribute of `p` (that is `name`, `age`, and `height`) for tuples in `People` that have a `height` greater than 190.

##### Example 2
- Relation `Student` has two attributes: `name`, `student_id`.
- Relation `Lecture` has three attributes: `name`, `lecture_id`, `lecture_type`, `location`.
- Relation `Professor` has two attributes: `name`, `professor_id`.
- Relation `teaches` has two attributes: `lecture_id`, `professor_id`.
- Relation `listens` has two attributes: `student_id`, `lecture_id`.
```python
from relational_calculus.tuple_calculus import *

# define the variable used
s = Variable('s', 'Student')
l = Variable('l', 'Lecture')
p = Variable('p', 'Professor')
t = Variable('t', 'teaches')
li = Variable('li', 'listens')

# define the expression
tc = TupleCalculus(
	# Return everything of p, followed by l.name, l.lecture_type and p.name
	Result([s, l["name"], l["lecture_type"], p["name"]]),
	# Formula
	And(
		And(And(s, l), p),
		Exists(
			{t, li},
			And(
				Equals(t["lecture_id"], li["lecture_id"]),
				And(
					And(
						Equals(li["student_id"], s["student_id"]),
						Equals(li["lecture_id"], l["lecture_id"])
					),
					And(
						Equals(t["professor_id"], p["professor_id"]),
						Equals(t["lecture_id"], l["lecture_id"])
					)
				)
			)
		)
	)
)

# check if the expression is valid
is_correct = tc.verify()

# get latex math mode string representation
latex = str(tc)

# convert the expression into an SQLite query
query = tc.to_sql()
```
`tc` will now return the all students `name`s and their `student_id`s who listen to a lecture `name` of type `lecture_type` and are taught by a professor with `name`.


### Domain Calculus
#### Atoms
The comparison operators can be used to bound/set the values of a variable, or compare two different variables.
```python
eq = Equals(x, "Hello!")
gt = GreaterThan(5, y)
le = LessEquals(z, 7.2)
lt = LessThan(a, b)
```
Variables are no atoms in the domain calculus. However, they still need to be typed. Since they only represent columns, we need multiple variables to make up a whole relation. We can also make initialize a column with a certain value. Then, all tuples must have that value in that specific column. Additionally, if one does not care for a single column, placeholders can be used:
> :warning: Make sure that the tuple object received the same amount of variables, placeholders and values as the actually used relation consists of.
```python
t1 = Tuple("some_relation",  [x, y, z])
t1 = Tuple("some_relation",  [x, y, "Hello!"])
t1 = Tuple("some_relation",  [x, 1.5, z])
t1 = Tuple("some_relation",  [x, y, None]) # placeholder
```

#### Quantifiers
When a variable is not being returned, it has to be quantified. This is done by using the `Forall` and `Exists` construct. `sub_formula` here refers to a formula generated by using other atoms, quantifiers, and connectives.
```python
forall = Forall(x, sub_formula)
exists = Exists(x, sub_formula)
```
If one wants to quantify multiple variables using the same quantification type at once, one can do so efficiently using sets.
```python
foralls = Forall({x,y,z}, sub_formula)
exists = Exists({x,y,z}, sub_formula)
```

#### Connectives
The connectives can be used to combine atoms, quantifiers, and connectives.
```python
and_formula = And(sub_formula_1, sub_formula_2)
or_formula = Or(sub_formula_1, sub_formula_2)
not_formula = Not(sub_formula)
```

#### Examples
##### Example 1
- Relation `People` has three attributes: `name`, `age`, and `height`.
```python
from relational_calculus.domain_calculus import *

# define the variable used
name = Variable('name')
age = Variable('age')
height = Variable('height')

# define the expression
dc = DomainCalculus(
	# Return
	Result([name, age, height]),
	# Formula
	And(
		Tuple("People", [name, age, height]),
		GreaterThan(height, 190)
	)
)

# check if the expression is valid
is_correct = dc.verify()

# get latex math mode string representation
latex = str(dc)

# convert the expression into an SQLite query
query = dc.to_sql()
```
`dc` will now return every tuple (`name`, `age`, `height`) for `People` that have a `height` greater than 190.

##### Example 2
- Relation `Student` has two attributes: `name`, `student_id`.
- Relation `Lecture` has three attributes: `name`, `lecture_id`, `lecture_type`, `location`.
- Relation `Professor` has two attributes: `name`, `professor_id`.
- Relation `teaches` has two attributes: `lecture_id`, `professor_id`.
- Relation `listens` has two attributes: `student_id`, `lecture_id`.
```python
from relational_calculus.domain_calculus import *

# define the variable used
s_name = Variable('s_name')
student_id = Variable('student_id')
l_name = Variable('l_name')
lecture_id = Variable('lecture_id')
lecture_type = Variable('lecture_type')
p_name = Variable('p_name')
professor_id = Variable('professor_id')


# define the expression
dc = DomainCalculus(
	# Return
	Result([s_name, student_id, l_name, lecture_type, p_name]),
	# Formula
	Exists(
		{lecture_id, professor_id},
		And(
			And(
				And(
					Tuple("Student", [s_name, student_id]),
					Tuple("Lecture", [l_name, lecture_id, lecture_type, None])
				),
				And(
					Tuple("Professor", [p_name, professor_id]),
					Tuple("teaches", [lecture_id, professor_id])
				)
			),
			Tuple("listens", [student_id, lecture_id])
		)
	)
)

# check if the expression is valid
is_correct = dc.verify()

# get latex math mode string representation
latex = str(dc)

# convert the expression into an SQLite query
query = dc.to_sql()
```
`dc` will now return the all students `name`s and their `student_id`s who listen to a lecture `name` of type `lecture_type` and are taught by a professor with `name`.
