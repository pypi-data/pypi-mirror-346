General-purpose log-space nested sampler for Bayesian inference which uses naive rejection sampling.

After installing you should be able to run the simple linear gaussian model example in `examples/example.py` which generates a two dimensional corner plot of the posterior distribution of the two linear coefficient parameters `a` and `b` and prints out the calculated log evidence
