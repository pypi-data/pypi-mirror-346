## Installation

Install the latest stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install brogscursor
```

When using this package in your application, it's recommended to pin to at least the major version:

```bash
pip install brogscursor==0.1.*
```

## Quick Start

Record and replay user actions in just 4 lines of code:

```python
from brogscursor import record

recorder = record()
recorder.start_recording()  # Press Esc to stop recording
recorder.replay(recorder.stop_recording())
```

Or use the command-line interface:

```bash
# Launch the interactive CLI
brogscursor
```

## Usage

### Basic Recording

```python
from brogscursor import record

# Create a recorder instance
recorder = record()

# Start recording (this will block until Escape is pressed)
recorder.start_recording()

# Save the recording
recording_file = recorder.stop_recording()
print(f"Recording saved to: {recording_file}")
```

### Replay Options

```python
from brogscursor import record

recorder = record()

# Replay with default settings
recorder.replay("path/to/recording.json")

# Customize replay
recorder.replay(
    "path/to/recording.json",
    precision_mode=True,       # Maintain exact timing
    filter_events=["scroll"],  # Skip scroll events
    loop_count=3,              # Repeat 3 times
    stop_key='s'               # Use 's' to stop instead of 'p'
)

# Change playback speed
recorder.speed_multiplier = 2.0  # 2x faster
recorder.replay("path/to/recording.json")
```

### Command-Line Interface

The package includes a command-line interface for easy use:

```bash
# Launch the interactive CLI
brogscursor
```

CLI Features:
- Start recording with optional timeout
- List and manage saved recordings
- Replay recordings with various settings
- Customize configuration

### Customizing Settings

```python
from brogscursor import record

# Create a recorder with custom settings
recorder = record(
    log_dir="my_recordings",   # Custom directory to save recordings
    max_events=10000,          # Maximum number of events to record
    record_keyboard=True,      # Record keyboard events
    speed_multiplier=1.5       # Default replay speed
)

# Start recording with a 30-second timeout
recorder.start_recording(timeout=30)
```

## Examples

Several example scripts are included to demonstrate the package's functionality:

- `examples/basic_usage.py`: Simple recording and replay
- `examples/custom_settings.py`: Using custom settings
- `examples/multi_replay.py`: Working with multiple recordings
- `examples/save_recordings.py`: Exporting recordings to different formats

## API Reference

### `BrogsCursorRecorder`

Main class for recording and replaying user actions.

#### Constructor

```python
recorder = BrogsCursorRecorder(
    log_dir=None,              # Directory to store recordings
    max_events=50000,          # Maximum events to record
    record_keyboard=True,      # Whether to record keyboard events
    speed_multiplier=1.0       # Default replay speed
)
```

#### Methods

- `start_recording(timeout=None)`: Start recording user actions
- `stop_recording()`: Stop recording and save to file
- `pause_recording()`: Pause ongoing recording
- `resume_recording()`: Resume paused recording
