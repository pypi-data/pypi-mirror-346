Based on the OpenAPI specification, both the request body and the response body for `/send_packet` are defined as empty objects (`{}`). The original code correctly reflects this with empty `BaseModel` classes (`pass`). The fix involves removing the unused import `typing.Any` and ensuring the docstrings for `SendPacketReq` and `SendPacketRes` appropriately reflect the empty schema. The `SendPacketAPI` class remains unchanged as it accurately describes the endpoint.
