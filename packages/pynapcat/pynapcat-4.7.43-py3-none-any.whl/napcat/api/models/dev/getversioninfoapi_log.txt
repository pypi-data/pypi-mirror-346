Analyzed the OpenAPI spec for `/get_version_info`. The request body is empty. The response body is a nested structure with a top-level object containing `status` (Literal 'ok'), `retcode` (number, assumed int), `data` (a nested object), `message` (string), `wording` (string), and `echo` (nullable string). The nested `data` object contains required string fields: `app_name`, `protocol_version`, `app_version`. Refactored the `GetVersionInfoRes` model to include a nested `GetVersionInfoResData` model for the `data` field. Used `Literal['ok']` for the status, `str | None` for nullable echo, and added descriptions using `Field`. Removed unused imports and `type: ignore`. Ensured all fields have type annotations.
