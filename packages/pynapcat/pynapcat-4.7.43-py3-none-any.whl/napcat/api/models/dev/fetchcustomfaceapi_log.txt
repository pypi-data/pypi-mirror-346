Based on the OpenAPI spec:
- Refactored FetchCustomFaceReq to include the 'count' field (int, default 48) with description.
- Refactored FetchCustomFaceRes to match the response schema:
  - 'status' is Literal["ok"].
  - 'retcode' is int.
  - 'data' is list[str].
  - 'message' is str.
  - 'wording' is str.
  - 'echo' is str | None.
  - Added descriptions for all fields.
- Removed unused 'Any' import.
- Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions.
- Removed `type: ignore`.
- Used built-in types (`list`, `str`, `int`) and `| None`.
- Added `Literal` import.
- No nested class was needed for 'data'.
