Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have refactored the Pydantic models:

1.  **SetGroupBanReq**: Added `group_id`, `user_id` (both `int | str`), and `duration` (`int`) fields with descriptions based on the request body schema.
2.  **SetGroupBanRes**: Added `status` (`Literal["ok"]`), `retcode` (`int`), `data` (`None`), `message` (`str`), `wording` (`str`), and `echo` (`str | None`) fields with descriptions. The `data` field is explicitly `None` as per the spec. `echo` is marked as `str | None` and defaults to `None`.
3.  Removed unused `Any` import.
4.  Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions using `Field`.
5.  Used `Literal["ok"]` for the `status` field.
6.  Followed the Pydantic v2 guidelines for type hinting (`int | str`, `str | None`).
7.  No nested classes were needed as the `data` field is null.
