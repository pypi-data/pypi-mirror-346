Refactoring the Python code for the 'set_online_status' endpoint. Analyzed the OpenAPI specification for request and response structures. The request body schema defines 'status', 'extStatus', and 'batteryStatus' as required numbers. The response body schema defines 'status' as 'ok' literal, 'retcode', 'data' as null, 'message', 'wording', and 'echo' (nullable string), all required. Applied pydanticV2 guidelines: used Python 3.13 type hints (including `| None` and `Literal`), removed deprecated typing imports, added Field descriptions and defaults, and removed unnecessary type ignores. The request model fields were named based on the OpenAPI schema properties (camelCase for extStatus, batteryStatus) despite the example using snake_case. The response model fields use snake_case as defined in the response properties.
