Based on the OpenAPI schema:
1. The endpoint is `/get_guild_list` using the POST method.
2. The request parameters are empty (`[]`). The `GetGuildListReq` model correctly reflects this with `pass`.
3. The 200 response schema shows an object with no properties (`{}`). This indicates the `data` field within the standard Napcat wrapper should be an empty object, represented by `dict` in Python.
4. The standard Napcat response wrapper (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `msg`, `wording`) is assumed.
5. The `status` field is typed using `Literal["ok", "failed"]` as per instructions and common practice.
6. `retcode`, `msg`, and `wording` are typed as `int` and `str` respectively.
7. `data` is typed as `dict` with `default_factory=dict` to represent the empty object.
8. Removed `type: ignore` comments.
9. Added `Literal` import.
10. Added descriptions to response fields using `Field`.
11. Verified type hints use native types where applicable.
