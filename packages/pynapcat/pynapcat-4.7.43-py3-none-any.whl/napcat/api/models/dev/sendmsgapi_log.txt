Based on the OpenAPI spec, the Pydantic v2 models for the request and response of the `send_msg` endpoint have been generated. This includes defining the specific message component models (text, at, face, image, reply, json, voice, video, markdown) as required by the `message` field in the request body. The response model includes a nested `Data` class for the `data` field, and uses `Literal['ok']` for the status. Type annotations are enforced, deprecated typing aliases are avoided, and Field is used for descriptions and defaults where specified. Unused imports have been removed.
