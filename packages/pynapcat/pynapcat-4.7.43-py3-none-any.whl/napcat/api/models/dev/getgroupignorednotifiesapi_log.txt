Based on the OpenAPI schema, I have refactored the `GetGroupIgnoredNotifiesRes` model. The request body is empty, so `GetGroupIgnoredNotifiesReq` remains a simple empty model. The response model now includes the root fields (`status`, `retcode`, etc.) and a nested `Data` model for the `data` field. Inside `Data`, there are `join_requests` and `InvitedRequest` fields, both lists of a nested `SystemInfo` model, which reflects the `系统信息` schema. Added descriptions and types for all fields according to the schema. Used `Literal['ok']` for the status field. Removed unused imports and ensured type hints follow the guidelines (e.g., `list` instead of `List`, `| None` instead of `Optional`).
