Refactoring the provided Python code based on the OpenAPI specification for the `/delete_group_folder` endpoint.

1.  **Analyze OpenAPI Spec:** Identified request requires `group_id` (number or string) and `folder_id` (string). Response follows a standard result structure with nested `data` containing `retCode`, `retMsg`, `clientWording`.
2.  **Refactor `DeleteGroupFolderReq`:** Added `group_id` (int | str) and `folder_id` (str) fields with descriptions based on the request body schema. Both are required.
3.  **Refactor `DeleteGroupFolderRes`:**
    *   Created an inner class `DeleteGroupFolderResData` for the nested `data` object with fields `retCode` (int), `retMsg` (str), and `clientWording` (str), all required.
    *   Defined the main `DeleteGroupFolderRes` class with fields: `status` (Literal["ok"]), `retcode` (int), `data` (DeleteGroupFolderResData), `message` (str), `wording` (str), `echo` (str | None).
    *   Added descriptions using `Field` for all fields.
    *   Ensured required fields are implicitly handled by Pydantic (no default value).
    *   Used `str | None` for `echo`.
4.  **Update `DeleteGroupFolderAPI`:** Ensured `Req` and `Res` point to the correctly refactored classes and use `type[BaseModel]`.
5.  **Clean Imports:** Removed unused imports and ensured necessary ones (`Literal`, `Field`, `BaseModel`) are present.
6.  **Type Hinting:** Applied consistent type hints following the specified guidelines (e.g., `int | str`, `str | None`).
7.  **Removed `# type: ignore`:** Cleaned up ignored type hints.
8.  **Added Descriptions:** Added descriptions to models and fields for clarity.

Result: Generated the corrected Python code for the `DeleteGroupFolderReq` and `DeleteGroupFolderRes` models and the `DeleteGroupFolderAPI` class, adhering to the pydantic v2 guidelines and the OpenAPI spec.
