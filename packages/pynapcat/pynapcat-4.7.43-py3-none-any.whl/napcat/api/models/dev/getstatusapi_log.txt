Successfully parsed OpenAPI specification for /get_status (POST). Created GetStatusReq as an empty BaseModel reflecting the empty request body. Created nested models GetStatusResDataStat and GetStatusResData based on the overridden 'data' schema. Created GetStatusRes model with Literal["ok"] for status, int for retcode, the nested data model, and required string fields message, wording, and nullable string echo. Added Field descriptions for all fields in response models. Removed unused imports (logging, Any). Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions. GetStatusAPI model linking Req and Res models is correct.
