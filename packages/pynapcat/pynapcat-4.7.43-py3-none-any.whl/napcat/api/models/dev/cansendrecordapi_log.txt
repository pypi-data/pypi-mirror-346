Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /can_send_record POST. Request body is empty. Response requires status (Literal['ok']), retcode (int), data (nested object with 'yes': bool), message (str), wording (str), echo (str|None). Refactoring CanSendRecordReq to be empty. Refactoring CanSendRecordRes to include required fields with types, descriptions using Field, and a nested Data model for the 'data' field. Using Literal['ok'] for status. Using str | None for echo. Removing unused imports. Ensuring all fields have type hints and descriptions.
