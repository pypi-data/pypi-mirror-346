Starting repair of SetGroupLeave models based on OpenAPI spec.
1. Analyzed OpenAPI spec for /set_group_leave: Request needs group_id (int|str) and optional is_dismiss (bool). Response has standard wrapper with status ('ok'), retcode (int), null data, message, wording, and optional echo (str|None). All response fields appear required based on schema, despite ignore list.
2. Refactored SetGroupLeaveReq: Added group_id (int|str, required with Field description) and is_dismiss (bool|None, optional with default=None and Field description).
3. Refactored SetGroupLeaveRes: Defined fields status (Literal['ok']), retcode (int), data (None - representing JSON null), message (str), wording (str), echo (str|None). Added Field descriptions. No nested Data class needed as data is null.
4. Reviewed SetGroupLeaveAPI: Correctly links Req and Res.
5. Reviewed imports: Removed unused Any. Added Literal.
6. Applied coding guidelines: Used appropriate type hints (int|str, bool|None, str|None, Literal). Added Field descriptions.
7. Generated final Python code.
8. Prepared JSON output.
