Refactoring initiated based on OpenAPI spec.
- Removed unused `typing.Any` import.
- Kept `logging` and `pydantic` imports.
- Added `typing.Literal` for status field.
- `GetFriendsWithCategoryReq` remains empty as per spec.
- Created `GetFriendsWithCategoryRes` model.
- Defined nested `FriendInfo` and `FriendCategory` models based on the spec's schemas.
- `GetFriendsWithCategoryRes` includes fields: `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`.
- `status` is typed as `Literal["ok"]`.
- `retcode`, `message`, `wording` are typed as specified.
- `echo` is typed as `str | None` with a default of `None`.
- `data` is typed as `list[FriendCategory]`.
- `FriendCategory` includes fields: `categoryId`, `categorySortId`, `categoryName`, `categoryMbCount`, `onlineCount`, `buddyList` with appropriate types and descriptions.
- `buddyList` in `FriendCategory` is typed as `list[FriendInfo]`.
- `FriendInfo` includes fields: `birthday_year`, `birthday_month`, `birthday_day`, `user_id`, `age`, `phone_num`, `email`, `category_id`, `nickname`, `remark`, `sex`, `level` with appropriate types and descriptions.
- All fields in `FriendInfo` and `FriendCategory` are marked as required (`...`) based on the spec's `required` arrays.
- All models include docstrings and fields have `Field` with descriptions.
- The `GetFriendsWithCategoryAPI` model is updated to reference the refined `GetFriendsWithCategoryRes`.
- Ensured compliance with pydanticV2 and Python 3.13 type hinting guidelines (using built-in types, `| None`).
