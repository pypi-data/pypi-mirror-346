Refactoring the provided Python code based on the OpenAPI specification. The request model SetGroupWholeBanReq will include 'group_id' (int | str) and 'enable' (bool). The response model SetGroupWholeBanRes will include 'status' (Literal["ok"]), 'retcode' (int), 'data' (None), 'message' (str), 'wording' (str), and 'echo' (str | None), matching the structure and types defined in the OpenAPI 200 response schema. Unused imports (logging, Any) will be removed. Type hints will follow Python 3.13 style (using '|' for unions and 'None' for optional/nullable). Field descriptions will be added.
