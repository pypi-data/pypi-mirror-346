Based on the provided OpenAPI specification, the following changes were made:
1.  Updated `NcGetUserStatusReq` to include the required `user_id` field, allowing it to be either an integer or a string, based on the `user_id` schema definition.
2.  Updated `NcGetUserStatusRes` to match the response structure.
    *   Added standard response fields: `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`.
    *   Used `Literal["ok"]` for the `status` field.
    *   Defined a nested `Data` model for the `data` field, including `status` and `ext_status` as integers.
    *   Used `int` for number types (`retcode`, `data.status`, `data.ext_status`) and `str` for string types (`message`, `wording`).
    *   Handled the nullable `echo` field using `str | None`.
    *   Added descriptions for all fields using `Field()`.
3.  Removed the unused `Any` import.
4.  Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions.
