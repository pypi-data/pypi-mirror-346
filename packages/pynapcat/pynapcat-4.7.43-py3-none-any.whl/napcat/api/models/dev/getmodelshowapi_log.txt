Based on the OpenAPI specification for /_get_model_show, I have updated the Pydantic models. The GetModelShowReq now correctly includes the 'model' field with type 'str' and default 'napcat'. The GetModelShowRes has been refactored to include nested models for 'data' -> list of 'ModelItem' -> 'variants'. Inner classes 'Variants' and 'ModelItem' are defined within GetModelShowRes. Field types are updated according to the spec (status is Literal["ok"], retcode is int, data is list[ModelItem], message, wording, echo with str | None). Required fields are marked, and descriptions are added using Field. Unused imports were removed. The GetModelShowAPI class remains unchanged as it correctly references the Req and Res models.
