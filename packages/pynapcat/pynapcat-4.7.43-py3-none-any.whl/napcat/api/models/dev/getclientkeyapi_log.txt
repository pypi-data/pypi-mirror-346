Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /get_clientkey. Request body is empty, keeping GetClientkeyReq as pass. Response follows a standard structure with a nested data field. Created a nested Data model inside GetClientkeyRes to handle the clientkey field. Used Literal['ok'] for the status field. Used str | None for the nullable echo field. Added descriptions and type hints to all fields using Field. Removed unused imports and type ignores. Ensured compliance with coding guidelines (no typing.Union/Optional, use | None, etc.).
