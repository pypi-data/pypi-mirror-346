Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /set_group_add_request POST. Identified request parameters (flag, approve, reason) and response structure (status, retcode, data=null, message, wording, echo). Refactored SetGroupAddRequestReq with flag (str), approve (bool), reason (str | None) using Field with descriptions. Refactored SetGroupAddRequestRes with status (Literal['ok']), retcode (int), data (None), message (str), wording (str), echo (str | None) using Field with descriptions. Removed unused imports (Any). Added necessary import (Literal). Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions. Confirmed no nested classes are needed for response data as it's null.
