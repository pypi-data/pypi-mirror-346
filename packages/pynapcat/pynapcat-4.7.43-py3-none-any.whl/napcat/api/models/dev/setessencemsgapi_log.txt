Based on the OpenAPI specification, the `SetEssenceMsgReq` model requires a `message_id` field that can be an integer or a string. The `SetEssenceMsgRes` model is significantly updated to reflect the nested structure and data types defined in the schema. Nested models `SetEssenceMsgResMsg`, `SetEssenceMsgResResult`, and `SetEssenceMsgResData` were created. `SetEssenceMsgResMsg` is an empty model as per the schema's `properties: {}`. Literal type `Literal["ok"]` is used for the `status` field. Data types like `int`, `str`, `float`, and `str | None` are used according to the schema and Python 3.13 type hinting guidelines. All fields are marked as required (`...`) unless nullable (`str | None`) and descriptions are added using `Field`. Unused imports were removed.
