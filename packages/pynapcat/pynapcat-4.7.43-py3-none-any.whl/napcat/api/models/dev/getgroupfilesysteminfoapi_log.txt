Based on the OpenAPI schema, refactored the GetGroupFileSystemInfoReq to include the required group_id field with union type int | str. Refactored GetGroupFileSystemInfoRes by defining an inner Data class for the data payload fields (file_count, limit_count, used_space, total_space) with float types and descriptions. Updated the main GetGroupFileSystemInfoRes fields including status as Literal["ok"], retcode as int, message, wording as str, and echo as str | None with a default value of None. Added Field with descriptions and requirement status (...) to all fields. Removed unused imports and type ignores. Ensured standard Python types and |/| None for unions/optional types are used.
