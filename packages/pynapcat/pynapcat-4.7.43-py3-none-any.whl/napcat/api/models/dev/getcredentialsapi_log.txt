Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /get_credentials POST.
Identified request body with 'domain' (string, required).
Identified response body matching 'result' schema with nested 'data'.
'data' object contains 'cookies' (string, required) and 'token' (number, required).
'status' is fixed to 'ok'. 'retcode' is a number. 'echo' is nullable string.
Refactoring `GetCredentialsReq` to include `domain: str`.
Refactoring `GetCredentialsRes`:
- Created nested `Data` class for the `data` field with `cookies: str` and `token: float` (using float for number).
- Added top-level fields: `status: Literal["ok"]`, `retcode: float`, `data: Data`, `message: str`, `wording: str`, `echo: str | None`.
- Added `Field` with descriptions for all fields.
- Removed unnecessary `typing.Any` import.
- Added `typing.Literal` import.
- Ensured correct type annotations according to guidelines (lowercase types, | None).
- Added docstrings to classes.
- Verified `GetCredentialsAPI` is correct.
