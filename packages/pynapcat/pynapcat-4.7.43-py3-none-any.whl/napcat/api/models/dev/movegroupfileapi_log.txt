Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have defined the MoveGroupFileReq model with the required fields group_id, file_id, current_parent_directory, and target_parent_directory, including their types and descriptions. For the MoveGroupFileRes model, I have created a nested Data class to represent the data field, containing the boolean field 'ok'. I have also set the 'status' field to use Literal['ok']. All fields now have appropriate type annotations and descriptions using Field. Removed unnecessary imports and type ignores.
