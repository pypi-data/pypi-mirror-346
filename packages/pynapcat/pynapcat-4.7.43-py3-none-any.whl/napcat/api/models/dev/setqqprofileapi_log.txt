Based on the OpenAPI spec, refactored the SetQqProfileReq to include nickname (required), personal_note, and sex (optional). Created a nested SetQqProfileResData model for the 'data' field in SetQqProfileRes. Defined SetQqProfileRes with status (Literal['ok']), retcode, data, message, wording, and echo (optional). Ensured all fields have type hints and descriptions using Field. Removed unused imports and corrected type annotations according to the guidelines.
