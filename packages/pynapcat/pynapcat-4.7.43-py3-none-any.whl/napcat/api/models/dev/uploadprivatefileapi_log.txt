Refactoring `UploadPrivateFileReq` and `UploadPrivateFileRes` based on the provided OpenAPI specification. `UploadPrivateFileReq` now includes `user_id`, `file`, and `name` fields with appropriate types and descriptions. `UploadPrivateFileRes` includes `status` (Literal['ok']), `retcode` (int), `data` (None), `message` (str), `wording` (str), and `echo` (str | None) fields with descriptions. Removed unused `Any` import. Ensured correct type hints and used `Field` for descriptions and potential defaults.
