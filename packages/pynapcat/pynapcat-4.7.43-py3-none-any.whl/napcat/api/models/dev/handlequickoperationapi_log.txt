Based on the OpenAPI spec, refactored the HandleQuickOperationReq to include required 'context' and 'operation' fields as dictionaries. Refactored HandleQuickOperationRes to include 'status' (Literal['ok']), 'retcode' (int), 'data' (None based on OpenAPI override), 'message' (str), 'wording' (str), and 'echo' (str | None). Added descriptions to fields using Field(). Removed unused imports and replaced typing aliases with built-in types and '| None'. Ensured all required fields are marked.
