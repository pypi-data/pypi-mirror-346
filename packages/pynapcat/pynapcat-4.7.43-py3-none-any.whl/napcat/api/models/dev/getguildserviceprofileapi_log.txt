Analyzing the OpenAPI specification reveals that the `/get_guild_service_profile` endpoint is a POST request with no parameters and returns an empty object as the response body. The provided code already reflects this with `pass` in both `GetGuildServiceProfileReq` and `GetGuildServiceProfileRes`. The `GetGuildServiceProfileAPI` class correctly links these.

Applying the instructions:
1.  **Remove unused imports:** `logging` and `typing.Any` are removed as they are not used in the model definitions.
2.  **Ensure type annotations:** Already present for `endpoint`, `method`, `Req`, and `Res` in the `API` class.
3.  **Ensure descriptions and initial values:** Added descriptions to `endpoint`, `method`, `Req`, and `Res` using `Field`. Initial values were already present.
4.  **Move external nested classes:** Not applicable as there are no external nested classes.
5.  **Use Literal for status/enums:** Not applicable as there is no status or enum field in the empty response schema.
6.  **Use Field for defaults/descriptions:** Applied to `API` class fields.
7.  **Remove unused imports:** Done.
8.  **Define nested models:** Not applicable.
9.  **Define enums:** Not applicable.
10. **Use CamelCase for enums:** Not applicable.

The resulting code cleans up unused imports and adds explicit descriptions using `Field` in the `API` class, while keeping the `pass` models for Req and Res as specified by the empty OpenAPI schema.
