Analyzing OpenAPI schema for /get_robot_uin_range POST endpoint. The request body is empty, so GetRobotUinRangeReq remains a simple BaseModel. The response body is an object with status, retcode, data, message, wording, and echo. Defined a nested model UinRangeItem for the objects within the data array, with minUin and maxUin as strings. Updated GetRobotUinRangeRes to include these fields with correct types (Literal["ok"] for status, int for retcode, list[UinRangeItem] for data, str for message and wording, str | None for echo) and added Field with descriptions and default values where applicable (echo=None). Removed unnecessary typing.Any import and # type: ignore comments. Ensured all fields have type annotations and descriptions.
