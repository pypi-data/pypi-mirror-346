Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have updated the `GetMiniAppArkReq` model to include all required and optional parameters with correct types and descriptions. I handled the `oneOf` types using union types (str | int | bool). An Enum `MiniAppArkType` was created for the `type` field. The `GetMiniAppArkRes` model remains empty as per the spec. Unused imports (`logging`, `Any`, `logger`) have been removed. All fields now have explicit type annotations and descriptions via `Field`. The `GetMiniAppArkAPI` class definition remains correct.
