Building model for endpoint: get_group_file_url.
Analyzing OpenAPI spec for request and response.
Request model (GetGroupFileUrlReq) requires 'group_id' (string or number) and 'file_id' (string). Added these fields with appropriate types (str | int and str) and descriptions.
Response model (GetGroupFileUrlRes) has top-level fields 'status', 'retcode', 'data', 'message', 'wording', 'echo'.
The 'data' field is a nested object with a required 'url' (string). Created a nested 'Data' model for this.
Updated types for top-level fields based on OpenAPI spec, including 'echo' as str | None.
Added descriptions and default values (or required indication ...) using Field.
Removed unused import 'Any'.
Ensured nested 'Data' model is defined within 'GetGroupFileUrlRes'.
Kept the API definition class as is, as it was correct.
