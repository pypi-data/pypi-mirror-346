Refining code based on OpenAPI spec for /_set_model_show.
Removed unused imports (logging, Any).
Defined SetModelShowReq with 'model' and 'model_show' fields based on requestBody schema. Both are required strings.
Defined SetModelShowRes based on the response schema (which references 'result' but overrides 'data' to null). Included status (str), retcode (int), data (None), message (str), wording (str), and echo (str | None). Added descriptions to all fields using Field(...).
Ensured correct type hints using built-in types and | None for nullable fields.
Maintained the SetModelShowAPI class referencing the updated models.
