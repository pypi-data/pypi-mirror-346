Refactored GetGroupFilesByFolderReq and GetGroupFilesByFolderRes based on the OpenAPI spec.
- Added required fields `group_id`, optional fields `folder_id` and `folder`, and field `file_count` with a default value to `GetGroupFilesByFolderReq`.
- Used `int | str` for `group_id` and `str | None` for optional string fields.
- Created nested `File` and `Folder` models based on the structure defined in the response data.
- Created a `Data` model to hold the lists of `File` and `Folder` objects.
- Defined `GetGroupFilesByFolderRes` with standard response fields (`status`, `retcode`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`) and the nested `Data` model.
- Added descriptions and required status using `Field`.
- Removed unused imports (`logging`, `Any`).
- Ensured all fields have type annotations.
- Used built-in type hints and `| None`.
