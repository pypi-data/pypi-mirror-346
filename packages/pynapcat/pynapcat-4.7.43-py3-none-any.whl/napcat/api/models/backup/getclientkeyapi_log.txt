Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /get_clientkey endpoint.
Identified empty request body.
Identified response structure with nested 'data' object containing a required 'clientkey' string.
Refactoring GetClientkeyReq: Keep as pass, add docstring.
Refactoring GetClientkeyRes: Define nested Data model with 'clientkey'. Define GetClientkeyRes fields based on spec (status, retcode, data, message, wording, echo) with correct types, required fields, and descriptions using Field. Use Literal for the 'status' field.
Reviewing imports: Remove unused 'Any'. Add 'Literal'.
Reviewing GetClientkeyAPI: Seems correct.
Applying code guidelines: Use str|None, standard types, mandatory type hints, descriptions, default values (implicitly via required or explicitly).
