Fixed the Python code based on the OpenAPI schema. Added Pydantic models for request and response bodies. Used `int | str` for `group_id` and `message_id` (oneOf number or string). Used `None` for the `data` field in the response as it's specified as `null`. Used `Literal['ok']` for the `status` field. Used `str | None` for the `echo` field (nullable). Added type annotations, descriptions using `Field`, and removed unused imports. Updated the API class references.
