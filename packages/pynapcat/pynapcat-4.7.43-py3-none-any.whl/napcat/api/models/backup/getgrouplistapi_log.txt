Refactoring the Python code based on the OpenAPI spec. Updated `GetGroupListReq` to include `no_cache` field with type boolean and default false. Updated `GetGroupListRes` to include `status` (Literal['ok']), `retcode` (int), `data` (list[dict]), `message` (str), `wording` (str), and `echo` (str | None) fields with appropriate descriptions and types according to the response schema. Removed unused imports (`logging`, `Any`). Added Field descriptions for all fields. Used `list[dict]` for the `data` field as the array items have no defined properties.
