Refactored GetAiCharactersReq and GetAiCharactersRes based on the OpenAPI specification. Added required fields `group_id` and `chat_type` to the request model with appropriate type hints (int | str). Defined nested Pydantic models `Character` and `CharacterType` for the response data structure. Updated GetAiCharactersRes to include all specified fields (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`) with correct types, including the list of nested `CharacterType` models for the `data` field and nullable `echo`. Added `Field` with descriptions for all fields. Removed unused imports.
