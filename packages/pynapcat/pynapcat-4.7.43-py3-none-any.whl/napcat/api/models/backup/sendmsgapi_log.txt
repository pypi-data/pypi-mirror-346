Refactoring based on OpenAPI spec:
- Defined specific models for message segments (TextSegment, AtSegment, etc.) based on component schemas.
- Created a Union type `MessageSegment` for the `message` list in the request.
- Defined `SendMsgReq` with mandatory fields and correct types.
- Defined `SendMsgResData` for the specific 'data' payload in the response.
- Defined `ResultBase` for common response fields.
- Defined `SendMsgRes` inheriting from `ResultBase` and overriding the 'data' field with `SendMsgResData`.
- Added Field descriptions and default values where specified in the spec.
- Removed unused imports (`Any`).
- Updated `SendMsgAPI` to reference the new Req/Res models.
- Ensured type hints follow Python 3.13 standards (e.g., `|`, `list`).
- Note: The OpenAPI spec defines the 'markdown消息' type as 'record'. This seems unusual and potentially an error in the spec, but the code follows the spec literally.
