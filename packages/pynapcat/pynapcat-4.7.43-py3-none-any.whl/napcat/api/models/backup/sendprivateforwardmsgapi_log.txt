Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have refactored the `SendPrivateForwardMsgReq` and `SendPrivateForwardMsgRes` models.

Request Model (`SendPrivateForwardMsgReq`):
- Added `user_id` field (int | str).
- Added `messages` field (list of `NodeMessage`).
- Defined nested models `NodeMessage` and `NodeData`.
- Defined various message segment models (Text, At, Face, Image, Reply, Json, Record, Video) as inner classes.
- Created a `MessageSegment` type alias using Union of all segment types for the `content` field in `NodeData`.
- Added descriptions and type hints to all fields.

Response Model (`SendPrivateForwardMsgRes`):
- Defined fields based on the common result structure and the specific data structure.
- Added `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, and `echo` fields.
- Defined nested model `SendPrivateForwardMsgDataRes` for the `data` field.
- Added descriptions and type hints to all fields, including `str | None` for nullable `echo`.

General Fixes:
- Removed unused imports (logging, Any).
- Removed `type: ignore` comments.
- Used standard Python type hints (list, int, str, | for Union/Optional).
- Ensured constant fields use `Literal`.
