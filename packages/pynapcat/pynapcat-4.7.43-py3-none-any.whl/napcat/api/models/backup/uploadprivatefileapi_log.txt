Analyzing the OpenAPI specification for `/upload_private_file` POST endpoint.
Identified the request body schema with `user_id` (oneOf number/string), `file` (string), and `name` (string), all required.
Identified the response schema (200) based on a common `result` schema, specifically noting that the `data` field should be `null` (None in Python) and `echo` is nullable.
Reviewed the provided Python code, noting placeholder models `UploadPrivateFileReq` and `UploadPrivateFileRes`.
Detected the use of `typing.Any` and `typing.type` which should be replaced according to guidelines.
Planned the necessary fixes:
- Define `UploadPrivateFileReq` with fields `user_id` (`int | str`), `file` (`str`), `name` (`str`), all required.
- Define `UploadPrivateFileRes` with fields `status` (`Literal['ok']`), `retcode` (`int`), `data` (`None`), `message` (`str`), `wording` (`str`), `echo` (`str | None`), all required based on the final required list in the response schema.
- Add descriptions using `Field` for all fields.
- Remove unnecessary imports and `type: ignore` comments.
- Update type hints to follow the guidelines (`int | str`, `str | None`, `Literal`).
Generated the corrected Python code based on this plan.
