Reviewing the provided Python code and OpenAPI spec for `_mark_all_as_read`. The request body is an empty object, which `MarkAllAsReadReq` correctly represents. The response schema defines fields `status`, `retcode`, `data` (as null), `message`, `wording`, and `echo` (nullable). The provided `MarkAllAsReadRes` is empty and needs to be updated to reflect this structure. Unused imports (`typing.Any`) will be removed. Type hints will be updated to use built-in types where applicable (`str | None` instead of `Optional`). Fields in `MarkAllAsReadRes` will be added with appropriate types, descriptions using `Field`, and default values/constraints (`status` constant, `data` as None, `echo` as nullable). `type: ignore` will be removed.
