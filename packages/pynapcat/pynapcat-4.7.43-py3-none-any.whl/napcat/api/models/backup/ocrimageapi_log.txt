Analyzing the OpenAPI specification for `.ocr_image` endpoint. Identified the request body with a required 'image' field (string). Identified the response structure including status, retcode, data (array of lines), message, wording, and optional echo. Each line contains text, coordinates (pt1-pt4), character boxes (charBox array), and score. Nested structures for coordinates and character boxes found. Defined Pydantic models: `Point` for coordinates, `CharBoxData` for character box details, `LineData` for a single line, `OcrImageReq` for the request, and `OcrImageRes` for the main response. Added type hints, Field descriptions, and marked required fields. Used `str | None` for nullable `echo`. Removed unused imports.
