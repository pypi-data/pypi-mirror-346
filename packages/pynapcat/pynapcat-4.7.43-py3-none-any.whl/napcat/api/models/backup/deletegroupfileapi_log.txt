Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /delete_group_file POST endpoint. Identified request and response schemas. Created `DeleteGroupFileReq` with `group_id` (int | str) and `file_id` (str) fields based on the request body schema. Created nested response models: `TransGroupFileResultResult`, `TransGroupFileResult`, `DeleteGroupFileData` to match the complex structure under `data`. Created the main `DeleteGroupFileRes` model with top-level fields (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`). Added `Field` with descriptions and types. Used `|` for union and nullable types. Removed unused imports (`Any`). Kept `DeleteGroupFileAPI` as is, as it represents the endpoint descriptor. Code refactored successfully according to guidelines.
