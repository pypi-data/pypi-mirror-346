Starting code repair based on OpenAPI spec and user guidelines.
1. Checked for unused imports: Removed `typing.Any` as it's not used. `logging` is kept as it might be used outside the models.
2. Ensured type annotations: Models `GetWordSlicesReq` and `GetWordSlicesRes` have no fields according to the spec, so no type annotations are needed for fields.
3. Ensured fields have descriptions and initial values: No fields to describe or initialize.
4. Moved internal nested classes: No nested classes to move.
5. Used Field for defaults/descriptions: No fields to apply this to.
6. Removed unused imports: Handled in step 1.
7. Defined nested models: No nested models in the spec.
8. Defined enums: No enums in the spec.
9. Added descriptions to models based on the endpoint summary '获取中文分词'.
10. Removed `type: ignore` comments as they are unnecessary for simple `BaseModel` subclasses.
11. Ensured compliance with Pydantic v2 and Python 3.13 guidelines (no old typing imports like Dict, List, Optional; use list, dict, | None).
Code repair complete. The models correctly reflect the empty schema defined in the OpenAPI spec.
