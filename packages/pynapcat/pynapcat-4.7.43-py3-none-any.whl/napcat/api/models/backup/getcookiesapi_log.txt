Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1.  **GetCookiesReq:** Added `domain: str = Field(..., description="需要获取cookies的域名")` to match the request body schema.
2.  **GetCookiesRes:**
    *   Defined a nested `Data` class with `cookies: str` and `bkn: str` fields, both required.
    *   Added base response fields (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`) to `GetCookiesRes` with appropriate types and descriptions.
    *   Used `str | None` for the nullable `echo` field.
3.  **Imports:** Removed unused `Any` import.
4.  **Descriptions:** Added descriptions using `Field` for all fields in request and response models.
5.  **Type Hints:** Ensured all fields have mandatory type hints using built-in types or `| None`.
6.  **Nesting:** Moved the data details into the nested `Data` class within `GetCookiesRes`.
