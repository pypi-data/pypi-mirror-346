Starting refactoring based on OpenAPI spec. The request body is empty. The response body is based on a result schema with an overridden 'data' field containing a required boolean 'yes'.

Steps:
1. Keep CanSendRecordReq as an empty BaseModel.
2. Create a nested BaseModel `CanSendRecordData` for the 'data' object, containing the required boolean field 'yes'.
3. Create CanSendRecordRes with fields matching the root response structure (status, retcode, data, message, wording, echo).
4. Use appropriate type hints (bool, int, str, CanSendRecordData, str | None).
5. Add Field with descriptions and default/const values.
6. Remove unused imports (typing.Any).
7. Keep CanSendRecordAPI.

Finished refactoring and code generation.
