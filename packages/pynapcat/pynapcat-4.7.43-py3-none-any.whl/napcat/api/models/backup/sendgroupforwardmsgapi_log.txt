Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /send_group_forward_msg endpoint.
Identified request body schema and response body schema.
Defined nested Pydantic models for various message types (TextMessage, FaceMessage, ImageMessage, ReplyMessage, JsonMessage, VideoMessage, FileMessage, MarkdownMessage).
Defined models for forward-specific structures (SendForwardMessage, ForwardNewsItem, Level2ForwardMessage, Level1ForwardMessage).
Created a union type `AnyInnerMessageType` for message types allowed within node content, handling recursive definition with a string forward reference initially, then updating it.
Defined SendGroupForwardMsgReq model based on the request schema, including required fields and their types.
Defined SendGroupForwardMsgRes model based on the response schema, including the nested data structure and nullable echo field.
Ensured correct type hints using built-in types, |, and Literal.
Added Field descriptions to all model fields.
Set default values for fields with defaults in the spec (e.g., ImageMessageData.summary, SendGroupForwardMsgRes.echo).
Removed unused imports.
Kept the API class structure.
Code structure is clean with nested models defined separately for potential reusability.
