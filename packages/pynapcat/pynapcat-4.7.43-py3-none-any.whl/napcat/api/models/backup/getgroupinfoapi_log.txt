Building Pydantic model for get_group_info based on OpenAPI spec.
- Removed unused import `Any`.
- Updated `GetGroupInfoReq` to include `group_id: int | str` with `Field` description.
- Updated `GetGroupInfoRes` to include `status: str`, `retcode: int`, `data: dict`, `message: str`, `wording: str`, `echo: str | None` with `Field` descriptions.
- Set `echo` default to `None` as it is nullable.
- Added basic docstrings to models.
- Kept `GetGroupInfoAPI` structure.
- Ensured Python 3.13 type hints (int | str, str | None, dict).
- Added descriptions using `Field` for all model fields.
- Confirmed no nested classes were needed based on the provided spec.
