Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /get_group_info_ex. Identified request body with required group_id (int|str). Analyzed response body structure, identifying nested objects and arrays. Defined nested Pydantic models for `groupOwnerId`, `groupBindGuildIds`, `groupExtFlameData`, `groupExcludeGuildIds`, `ExtInfo`, and `Data`. Constructed the main `GetGroupInfoExRes` model. Created `GetGroupInfoExReq` for the request body. Ensured correct type hints (Python 3.13 style), added `Field` with descriptions, and removed unused imports. Adjusted `echo` type to `None` based on the schema.
