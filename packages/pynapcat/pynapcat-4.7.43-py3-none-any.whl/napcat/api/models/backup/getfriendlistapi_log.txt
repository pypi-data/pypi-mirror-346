Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1. Updated GetFriendListReq to include the required boolean field 'no_cache' with its default value and description.
2. Created a nested Pydantic model 'FriendInfo' to represent the items in the 'data' list of the response, including all required fields with types and descriptions.
3. Updated GetFriendListRes to match the response structure, including 'status' (Literal['ok']), 'retcode' (int), 'data' (list[FriendInfo]), 'message' (str), 'wording' (str), and 'echo' (str | None).
4. Added descriptions and default values (where applicable) to fields.
5. Ensured Python 3.13 type hints (e.g., list, str | None) are used.
6. Removed unused imports and type ignores.
7. Kept the GetFriendListAPI class as is.
