Based on the OpenAPI specification for the /get_stranger_info endpoint:

1.  **Request Model (GetStrangerInfoReq):** The spec requires a `user_id` field which can be a number or a string. Updated the model to include `user_id: int | str = Field(..., description="用户ID")`.
2.  **Response Model (GetStrangerInfoRes):**
    *   The response has a standard wrapper structure (`status`, `retcode`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`).
    *   It contains a nested `data` object with detailed user information. Defined an inner `StrangerInfoData` BaseModel for this.
    *   Populated the `StrangerInfoData` model with fields like `user_id`, `uid`, `nickname`, `age`, `qqLevel`, etc., using appropriate types (`int`, `str`, `bool`). Added descriptions for each field.
    *   Identified `qqLevel` in the spec which is camelCase and should be `qq_level` in the Python model. Added `alias="qqLevel"` to the `qq_level` field. Included `model_config = {"populate_by_name": True}` for Pydantic v2 to handle aliases correctly.
    *   Populated the main `GetStrangerInfoRes` model with the wrapper fields and the nested `data: StrangerInfoData` field.
    *   Set `status` to `str = Field("ok", description="响应状态", const="ok")` as per the spec's constant value.
    *   Set `echo` to `str | None = Field(None, description="Echo字段")` as it's nullable in the spec.
    *   Added descriptions for all fields in `GetStrangerInfoRes`.
    *   Followed the guideline to define the nested `StrangerInfoData` class inside `GetStrangerInfoRes`.
3.  **Imports:** Removed unused `typing.Any` import.
4.  **Guidelines:** Ensured use of built-in types, `| None` for nullable fields, `Field` with descriptions, and handled the alias for `qqLevel`. Removed type ignore comments.
5.  **API Class:** The `GetStrangerInfoAPI` class was already structured correctly, referencing the request and response models. No changes were needed here.

Code has been refactored to align with the OpenAPI spec and the provided coding guidelines.
