Audit successful. Applied the following changes:
1. Refactored message segment classes (TextMessageSegment, AtMessageSegment, etc.) to use nested `Data` classes.
2. Refactored `GetMsgResData` to use a nested `Sender` class.
3. Updated the `status` field in `GetMsgRes` to have a default value of "ok" and corrected the description per rule 2.
4. Changed `group_id` in `GetMsgResData` to be a required `int` based on the original code's schema note.
5. Added `Union` to imports for clarity although `|` syntax makes it optional.
6. Added Literal types for `message_type`, `message_format`, `post_type` in `GetMsgResData` based on descriptions suggesting fixed values.
7. Simplified message segment union definition and removed redundant `RecordMarkdownMessageSegment` class as it shares the same type ('record') and should be handled by data structure logic if needed.
8. Ensured class names are in CamelCase and field names are descriptive.
9. Verified recursive type hints for ForwardMessageSegment are handled correctly by Pydantic v2.
No syntax errors found.
