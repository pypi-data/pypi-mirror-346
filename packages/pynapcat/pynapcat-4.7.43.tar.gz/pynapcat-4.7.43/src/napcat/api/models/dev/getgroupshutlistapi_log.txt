Based on the OpenAPI spec:
1. Defined `GetGroupShutListReq` with the required `group_id` field (int or str).
2. Defined a nested model `GroupShutMember` to represent items in the `data` array of the response.
3. Mapped all fields from the OpenAPI spec for `GroupShutMember`, adding descriptions and required fields using `Field(...)`.
4. Handled the `groupHonor` field as a `dict` based on the empty object definition.
5. Defined `GetGroupShutListRes` including `status` (Literal['ok']), `retcode`, `data` (list of `GroupShutMember`), `message`, `wording`, and `echo` (str | None with default=None).
6. Ensured all type hints use built-in types and `| None`.
7. Added descriptions for all fields in both request and response models.
8. Removed unused imports (`typing.Any`).
9. Updated the `@description` in the metadata.
