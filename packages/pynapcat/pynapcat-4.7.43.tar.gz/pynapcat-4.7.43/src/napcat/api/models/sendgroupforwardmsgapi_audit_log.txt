Audit successful. The following changes were made:
1. Corrected the `status` field in `SendGroupForwardMsgRes` to use `Field("ok", description="状态码，固定为 'ok'")`.
2. Adjusted the type hint for `content` in `ForwardMessageNodeData` from `list[any]` to `list[dict]` as message content is typically a list of message segments, each represented as a dictionary.
3. Added default values (empty list for `news` and empty strings for `prompt`, `summary`, `source`) to fields in `SendGroupForwardMsgReq` that might not always be required depending on the specific use case or API implementation, making the model more flexible.
