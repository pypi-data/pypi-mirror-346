Based on the provided OpenAPI specification, I have:
1. Updated the `GetGroupInfoExReq` model to include the required `group_id` field, which can be either a string or an integer.
2. Created nested Pydantic models (`GroupOwnerId`, `GroupBindGuildIds`, `GroupExtFlameData`, `GroupExcludeGuildIds`, `ExtInfo`, `Data`) to accurately reflect the complex structure of the `data` field in the response.
3. Defined the `GetGroupInfoExRes` model with fields `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, and `echo`, using the appropriate nested models and scalar types.
4. Used `Literal["ok"]` for the `status` field based on the example.
5. Used `None` for the `echo` field as it's marked as `null` and required.
6. Added type annotations to all fields according to the specification.
7. Removed unused imports (`Any`).
8. Added descriptions to fields using `Field` where appropriate, especially for the nested structures.
9. Removed `type: ignore` comments.
