Based on the OpenAPI spec:
- Removed unused `logging` and `Any` imports.
- Added `Literal` import for the response status.
- Defined `ArksharepeerReq` with `group_id`, `user_id` (both `int | str | None`) and `phoneNumber` (`str | None`). Added Field descriptions.
- Defined `ArksharepeerRes`. Created a nested `Data` model within it as specified by the `data` field structure.
- The nested `Data` model includes `errCode` (`int`), `errMsg` (`str`), and `arkJson` (`str`), marked as required within the `data` object in the spec.
- `ArksharepeerRes` includes `status` (`Literal["ok"]`), `retcode` (`int`), `data` (`Data`), `message` (`str`), `wording` (`str`), and `echo` (`str | None`). Added Field descriptions for all.
- Ensured `status` and `echo` types match the spec (`const: ok` -> Literal, `nullable: true` -> | None).
- Updated `ArksharepeerAPI` to use `Literal` for `endpoint` and `method` and reference the new `Req` and `Res` models.
- Added basic descriptions to models.
- Adhered to Python 3.13 type hinting and pydantic v2 standards (no typing.Union/Optional, use |, type[]).
- Added a note in the request model about the likely mutual exclusivity/requirement of one of the fields, as the spec lacks a `required` array for the request body schema.
