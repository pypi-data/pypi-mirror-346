Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /_del_group_notice POST.
Identified request body with required fields group_id (oneOf number/string) and notice_id (string).
Identified response body with required fields status (const ok), retcode (number), data (object with nested result (number) and errMsg (string)), message (string), wording (string), and nullable echo (string).
Reviewing provided code: Req and Res models are placeholders. Imports logging and Any are unused. Missing type annotations, descriptions, and initial values. Response structure needs nested Data class and Literal for status.
Applying fixes:
- Removing unused imports logging and Any.
- Updating DelGroupNoticeReq with group_id (int|str) and notice_id (str) with Field descriptions.
- Creating nested DelGroupNoticeResData class for the 'data' field with result (int|float) and errMsg (str) fields.
- Updating DelGroupNoticeRes with status (Literal['ok']), retcode (int|float), data (using DelGroupNoticeResData), message (str), wording (str), and echo (str|None), all with Field descriptions and required flag (...).
- DelGroupNoticeAPI seems correct and references the updated Req/Res classes.
Ensuring all type annotations use built-in types or `| None` / `|`.
Final code generated conforms to pydanticV2 and python3.13 guidelines.
