Analyzing the OpenAPI specification for the `/set_qq_avatar` endpoint.
- Request body requires a `file` field of type string.
- Response body follows a standard structure with `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`.
- The `data` field in the response is explicitly defined as `null`.

Refactoring `SetQqAvatarReq`:
- Add the `file: str` field.
- Mark `file` as required using `Field(...)` and add a description.

Refactoring `SetQqAvatarRes`:
- Add fields `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`.
- Assign appropriate types: `status: str`, `retcode: int`, `data: None`, `message: str`, `wording: str`, `echo: str | None`.
- Add default values and descriptions using `Field`.
- `status` has a default of 'ok'.
- `data` is `None` as per the spec override.
- `echo` is nullable (`str | None`).

Reviewing Imports:
- Remove `typing.Any` as specific types are used.
- Keep `logging` as it might be used elsewhere (though not strictly in the models).
- Keep `BaseModel` and `Field`.

Reviewing `SetQqAvatarAPI`:
- The structure seems correct for linking the request and response models.

Applying Guidelines:
- Use built-in types and `| None`.
- Add `Field` with descriptions and defaults.
- Remove unused imports.
- No nested classes or enums are required based on this spec.
- Field names are already snake_case in the spec, aligning with Python standards.
