Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1. Analyzed the OpenAPI spec, which indicates a GET request with no parameters and an empty response body ({}).
2. Analyzed the provided Python code and compared it to the spec.
3. Removed unused imports: `logging`, `Any`, `Field`.
4. Confirmed `SetDoubtFriendsAddRequestReq` and `SetDoubtFriendsAddRequestRes` are correctly defined as empty `BaseModel`s, matching the spec.
5. Confirmed type annotations are present where needed.
6. Added descriptions to fields in `SetDoubtFriendsAddRequestAPI` for better clarity.
7. Verified the HTTP method is correctly set to 'GET' based on the OpenAPI spec.
8. No nested classes or Literal types were needed as per the spec.
