Starting to fix the pydantic models based on the OpenAPI specification for the /ArkShareGroup endpoint.

1.  Analyze the OpenAPI spec for the request body.
    -   Found required parameter `group_id` of type `string`.
    -   Update `ArksharegroupReq` to include this field.

2.  Analyze the OpenAPI spec for the response body (status 200).
    -   Found parameters: `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`.
    -   `status`: string, const "ok". Will use `Literal["ok"]`.
    -   `retcode`: number. Will use `int`.
    -   `data`: string (description "卡片json"). Will use `str`.
    -   `message`: string. Will use `str`.
    -   `wording`: string. Will use `str`.
    -   `echo`: string, nullable. Will use `str | None`.
    -   All response fields are marked as required in the spec override.
    -   Update `ArksharegroupRes` to include these fields with appropriate types and descriptions.
    -   No need for a nested `Data` class as `data` is a simple string type in the override.

3.  Review imports: `typing.Any` is not used. Remove it.

4.  Ensure all fields have type annotations and descriptions.

5.  Ensure correct type hints (`str`, `int`, `str | None`, `Literal`).

6.  Add `Field` with descriptions.

7.  Keep the overall structure of `Req`, `Res`, and `API` classes.

8.  Format the output as a JSON object.
