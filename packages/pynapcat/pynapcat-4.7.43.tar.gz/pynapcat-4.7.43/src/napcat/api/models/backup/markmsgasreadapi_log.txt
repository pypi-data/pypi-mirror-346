Refactoring the code based on the OpenAPI specification. Applied the following changes: Removed unused imports (logging, Any). Updated type hints to use built-in types (str | int | None for oneOf number/string and optional parameters, None for explicit null). Added Field descriptions and default values (or '...' for required fields) as per the schema. Implemented a model_validator in the request model to enforce the 'either-or' requirement for group_id and user_id. Defined all response fields with appropriate types (str, int | float, None, str | None) and descriptions based on the schema, handling the explicit null data field.
