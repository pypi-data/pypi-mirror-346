Parsed OpenAPI spec for /get_friend_msg_history.
Created GetFriendMsgHistoryReq model with user_id (int|str, required), message_seq (int|str, default 0), count (int, default 20), reverseOrder (bool, default False).
Created Sender model with Literal types for sex and role.
Created nested models for each message segment type (TextMessage, AtMessage, FaceMessage, ImageMessage, FileMessage, ReplyMessage, JsonMessage, VoiceMessage, VideoMessage, MarkdownMessage, ForwardMessage) including their respective Data models.
Defined MessageSegment as a union of all message segment types.
Created MessageDetail model, including the 'message' field as a list of MessageSegment.

Created GetFriendMsgHistoryRes model, incorporating fields from the 'result' schema and the specific 'data' structure with Literal['ok'] for status.
