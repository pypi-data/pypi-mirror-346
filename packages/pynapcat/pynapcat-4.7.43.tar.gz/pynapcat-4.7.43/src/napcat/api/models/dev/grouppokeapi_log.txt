Analyzing OpenAPI spec for /group_poke POST.
Request body requires group_id (number|string) and user_id (number|string). Both are required.
Fixed GroupPokeReq to include group_id and user_id with type hint int | str and Field descriptions.
Response body follows the result schema structure without the data field, containing status (ok literal), retcode (number), message (string), wording (string), and echo (string|null). All are required.
Fixed GroupPokeRes to include status (Literal["ok"]), retcode (int), message (str), wording (str), and echo (str | None) with Field descriptions and appropriate types.
Removed unused imports (logging, Any).
Added Literal import.
Ensured all fields have type hints and descriptions.
Removed type: ignore comments.
Ensured no deprecated typing imports are used.
Added examples to request fields for clarity.
