Fixed the code based on the OpenAPI spec and guidelines. Corrected GetCookiesReq to include the 'domain' field. Corrected GetCookiesRes to include the 'status', 'retcode', 'data', 'message', 'wording', and 'echo' fields. Defined a nested 'Data' class for the 'data' field containing 'cookies' and 'bkn'. Used Literal['ok'] for the status field. Added type hints, descriptions, and default values (or required indicators) using pydantic.Field. Removed unused imports and replaced typing.Optional/Union implicit usage with | None where needed (for echo). Ensured compliance with Python 3.13 type hinting standards and pydantic V2.
