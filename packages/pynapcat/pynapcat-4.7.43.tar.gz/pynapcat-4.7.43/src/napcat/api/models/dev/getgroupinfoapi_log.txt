Refactoring `get_group_info` models based on OpenAPI spec.
1. Added `group_id: int | str = Field(..., description="群号")` to `GetGroupInfoReq` based on requestBody schema.
2. Defined `GetGroupInfoResData` model based on the `#/components/schemas/群信息` schema, including all properties with appropriate types (`int` or `str`) and descriptions.
3. Defined `GetGroupInfoRes` model based on the response schema.
4. Used `Literal["ok"]` for the `status` field.
5. Used `int` for `retcode`, `group_all_shut`, `member_count`, `max_member_count` based on `type: number` in the spec.
6. Used `GetGroupInfoResData` as the type for the `data` field in `GetGroupInfoRes`.
7. Used `str | None` for the `echo` field based on `nullable: true`.
8. Added `Field` with descriptions to all fields in `GetGroupInfoReq`, `GetGroupInfoRes`, and `GetGroupInfoResData`.
9. Removed unused import `Any`.
10. Added import `Literal`.
11. Updated docstrings and metadata.
12. Ensured type annotations adhere to guidelines (no typing.List, Union, etc.).
