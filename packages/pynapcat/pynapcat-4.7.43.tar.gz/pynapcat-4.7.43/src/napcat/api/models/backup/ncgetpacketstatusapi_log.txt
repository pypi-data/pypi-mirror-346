Analyzing the OpenAPI specification for the `/nc_get_packet_status` endpoint.
The request body is an empty object, so `NcGetPacketStatusReq` remains an empty BaseModel.
The response body is an object with fields `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, and `echo`.
The `data` field is specifically overridden to be `null` in the response schema, so it will be typed as `None`.
`status`, `retcode`, `message`, `wording` are required fields with basic types (string, number).
`echo` is a nullable string, so it should be typed as `str | None`.
All required fields will be added to `NcGetPacketStatusRes` with appropriate types and descriptions using `pydantic.Field`.
Removed unused `typing.Any` import.
Ensured type annotations follow Python 3.13 guidelines (`str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`).
Removed `type: ignore` comments.
