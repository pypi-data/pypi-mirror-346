Analyzing the provided OpenAPI specification for the `/get_group_ignored_notifies` endpoint. The request requires a `group_id` (string or number). The response is based on a `result` schema, including `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`. The `data` field contains a list of `join_requests`, where each request item has fields like `request_id`, `requester_uin`, `requester_nick`, `group_id`, `group_name`, `checked`, and `actor` (string or number). All fields in the request item and the main response (except `echo` which is nullable) are required. Refactoring the Pydantic models to include these fields, nested models for `data` and `join_requests` items, correct type hints, and descriptions using `Field`. Removing unused imports and adhering to the Python 3.13 type hinting style (using `|` and built-in types).
