Based on the OpenAPI specification, the request body is empty, so the `NcGetPacketStatusReq` model with `pass` is correct. The response model `NcGetPacketStatusRes` was updated to include the standard fields (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`) as defined in the spec. `status` was changed to `Literal["ok"]`, `retcode` to `int`, `data` to `None` (as per the 'null' type in the spec), `message` and `wording` to `str`, and `echo` to `str | None` to handle nullable strings. `Field` is used to add descriptions to the fields. Unused imports like `Any` were removed. `Literal` from `typing` was added for the status field.
