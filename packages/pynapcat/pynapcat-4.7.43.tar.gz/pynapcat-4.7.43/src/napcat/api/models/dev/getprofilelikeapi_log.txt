Refactoring `GetProfileLikeReq`: Added fields `user_id`, `start`, `count` with types, defaults, and descriptions based on OpenAPI spec. Refactoring `GetProfileLikeRes`: Defined nested models `UserInfoItem`, `FavoriteInfo`, `VoteInfo`, `Data`. Updated `GetProfileLikeRes` to include fields `status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo` with correct types (Literal for status, nested models for data, | None for nullable echo) and descriptions. Used `float` for OpenAPI 'number' types. Removed unused `typing.Any` import. Ensured all required fields are marked appropriately (either by default being non-None or using ...). Maintained `GetProfileLikeAPI` structure.
