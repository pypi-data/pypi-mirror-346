Based on the OpenAPI spec:
1.  Removed unused imports (`logging`).
2.  Added necessary imports (`Literal`).
3.  Defined `SendGroupAiRecordReq` with `group_id` (`int | str`), `character` (`str`), and `text` (`str`) fields, all marked as required with descriptions.
4.  Defined `SendGroupAiRecordRes` with `status` (`Literal["ok"]`), `retcode` (`int`), `data` (nested model), `message` (`str`), `wording` (`str`), and `echo` (`str | None`) fields. All are marked as required and have descriptions.
5.  Created a nested `Data` class inside `SendGroupAiRecordRes` to model the `data` field, containing `message_id` (`str`).
6.  Ensured all fields have explicit type annotations.
7.  Used `|` for union types (`int | str`, `str | None`).
8.  Used `Literal["ok"]` for the `status` field.
9.  Added descriptions using `Field`.
10. Kept the `SendGroupAiRecordAPI` model as is, updating the Req and Res types.
