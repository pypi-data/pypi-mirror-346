Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1. Updated `UploadGroupFileReq` to include `group_id` (int | str), `file` (str), `name` (str) as required fields, and `folder` (str | None), `folder_id` (str | None) as optional fields, with descriptions.
2. Updated `UploadGroupFileRes` to include `status` (Literal['ok']), `retcode` (int), `data` (None), `message` (str), `wording` (str), and `echo` (str | None), based on the response schema. `data` is explicitly `None` based on the OpenAPI override.
3. Removed unused import `Any` and `logging`.
4. Added `Literal` import from `typing`.
5. Ensured type annotations are correct and follow the `| None` style.
6. Added descriptions to fields using `Field`.
