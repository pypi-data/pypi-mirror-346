Analyzing the OpenAPI spec for /get_credentials. The request requires a 'domain' string. The response is a standard result structure containing 'status' (const 'ok'), 'retcode' (number), 'message' (string), 'wording' (string), 'echo' (string|null), and a 'data' object. The 'data' object contains 'cookies' (string) and 'token' (number). Refactoring GetCredentialsReq to include 'domain'. Creating a nested Data model for GetCredentialsRes and including the required fields with appropriate types and descriptions. Removing unused imports and type ignores. Ensuring fields have descriptions using Field.
