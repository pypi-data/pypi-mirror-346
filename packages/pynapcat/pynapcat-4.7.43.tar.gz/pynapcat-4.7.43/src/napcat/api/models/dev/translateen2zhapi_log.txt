Refactoring the Pydantic models based on the OpenAPI schema.
1. Added the 'words' field to TranslateEn2zhReq as required by the request body schema (array of strings).
2. Defined all required response fields ('status', 'retcode', 'data', 'message', 'wording', 'echo') in TranslateEn2zhRes.
3. Used Literal["ok"] for the 'status' field.
4. Used list[str] for the 'data' field, as specified by the overridden schema for the response.
5. Used str | None for the 'echo' field to handle nullability.
6. Added Field with descriptions for all fields.
7. Removed unused import 'Any'.
8. Removed `type: ignore` comments.
