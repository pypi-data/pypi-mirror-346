Based on the provided OpenAPI specification, the CreateCollectionReq model was populated with required fields `rawData` and `brief` of type `str`. The CreateCollectionRes model was restructured to include the required fields: `status` (using `Literal["ok"]`), `retcode` (`int`), `data` (defined as a nested `Data` model), `message` (`str`), `wording` (`str`), and `echo` (`str | None`). The nested `Data` model includes `result` (`int`) and `errMsg` (`str`). Descriptions were added to all fields using `Field`. Unused imports (`Any`) were removed. Type hints were updated to comply with Python 3.13 standards (`str | None`, `list`, etc.). The overall structure now accurately reflects the API definition.
