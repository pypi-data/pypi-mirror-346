Refactoring code based on OpenAPI spec:
1. Removed unused `logging` and `Any` imports.
2. Added `Literal` import.
3. Implemented `MarkGroupMsgAsReadReq` with required `group_id: int | str` field and description.
4. Implemented `MarkGroupMsgAsReadRes` with fields: `status: Literal["ok"]`, `retcode: int`, `data: None`, `message: str`, `wording: str`, `echo: str | None`. Added descriptions for all fields.
5. Kept `MarkGroupMsgAsReadAPI` as is.
6. Removed `type: ignore`.
