- Made the 'echo' field in GetFriendMsgHistoryRes optional by setting the default to None, aligning with the description "可能为null".
- Made 'card' and 'group_id' fields in Sender and MessageDetail respectively optional (defaulting to None) as they are specific to group messages.

- Added 'app' to Literal for JsonMessage type and 'voice' to Literal for VoiceMessage type based on common Napcat/OneBot usage.
