Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1. Analyzed the request body: It's an empty object, so `GetLoginInfoReq` remains an empty `BaseModel`.
2. Analyzed the response body:
    - It has a nested `data` object.
    - Created an inner class `GetLoginInfoData` within `GetLoginInfoRes` to represent the `data` structure.
    - Added fields `user_id` (int) and `nickname` (str) to `GetLoginInfoData` as required by the spec.
    - Added fields `status` (str, const='ok'), `retcode` (int), `data` (GetLoginInfoData), `message` (str), `wording` (str), and `echo` (str | None) to `GetLoginInfoRes`.
    - Ensured all fields in `GetLoginInfoRes` and `GetLoginInfoData` are typed and marked as required where applicable (using `...` or no default).
3. Added descriptions to fields based on the OpenAPI spec context.
4. Removed unused imports (`logging`, `typing.Any`).
5. Removed `type: ignore` comments.
6. Confirmed `GetLoginInfoAPI` is correct.
