Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have refactored the Python code. The `GetGroupListReq` model now includes the `no_cache` boolean field with its default value and description. The `GetGroupListRes` model has been updated to match the response structure. A nested `GroupInfo` model was created for the items in the `data` array. The top-level response fields (`status`, `retcode`, `data`, `message`, `wording`, `echo`) have been added with correct types, descriptions, and required status (using `Field(...)`). `Literal["ok"]` is used for the status field, and `str | None` for the nullable `echo` field. Removed unused imports (`Any`). Ensured all fields have descriptions and default values where specified. Added type hints according to Python 3.13 best practices (using built-in types and `| None`).
