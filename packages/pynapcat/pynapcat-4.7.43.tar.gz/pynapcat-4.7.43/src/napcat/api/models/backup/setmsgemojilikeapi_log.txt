Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have updated the `SetMsgEmojiLikeReq` model to include `message_id` (int | str), `emoji_id` (int), and `set` (bool) fields with descriptions and set them as required. For the response, I have created a nested `Data` model within `SetMsgEmojiLikeRes` to represent the `data` object with `result` (int) and `errMsg` (str). The main `SetMsgEmojiLikeRes` model now includes `status` (Literal['ok']), `retcode` (int), the nested `data` model, `message` (str), `wording` (str), and `echo` (str | None), all with appropriate types, descriptions, and default values where applicable (like `echo` being nullable). Removed unused imports (`Any`) and ensured type hints follow the specified guidelines (e.g., using `int | str` instead of `Union[int, str]`). Added descriptions using `Field` for clarity.
