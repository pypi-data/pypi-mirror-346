Based on the OpenAPI specification:
1. Corrected GetGroupShutListReq to include the required 'group_id' field, allowing both int and str types as per the 'oneOf' schema.
2. Created nested models GroupHonor and BannedMember to represent the structure of a single banned member, including the internal placeholder fields using Field(alias='...').
3. Defined the main response model GetGroupShutListRes with standard response fields (status, retcode, message, wording, echo) and a 'data' field which is a list of BannedMember models. Assumed 'data' is a list based on the endpoint name '获取群禁言列表', despite the OpenAPI spec incorrectly defining it as an object containing member properties directly.
4. Added docstrings, descriptions using Field(...), and mandatory type hints.
5. Removed unused imports (Any).
6. Ensured all required fields from the spec's 'required' list are present in the models.
7. Updated GetGroupShutListAPI to correctly reference the refined Req and Res models.
