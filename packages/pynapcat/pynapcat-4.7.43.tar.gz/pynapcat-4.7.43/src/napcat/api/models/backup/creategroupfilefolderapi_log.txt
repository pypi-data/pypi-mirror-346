Analyzing the provided OpenAPI spec for the `/create_group_file_folder` endpoint. The request body requires `group_id` (int or str) and `folder_name` (str). The response body is a nested structure containing status, retcode, data, message, wording, and echo. The 'data' field further contains 'result' and 'groupItem'. 'groupItem' contains 'folderInfo'. The existing code had empty request and response models. The fix involves creating the necessary fields in the request model and defining nested BaseModel classes for the complex response structure, adding type annotations, descriptions, and handling the nullable 'echo' field using '| None'. Unused imports 'logging' and 'Any' will be removed. The `# type: ignore` comments will be removed as types are now correctly specified.
