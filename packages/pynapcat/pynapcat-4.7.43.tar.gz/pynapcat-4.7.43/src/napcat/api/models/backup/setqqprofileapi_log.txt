Refactored SetQqProfileReq to include nickname, personal_note, and sex fields with type annotations and descriptions based on the OpenAPI spec. Refactored SetQqProfileRes to include the standard response structure (status, retcode, data, message, wording, echo) with correct types, descriptions, and nullable handling. Defined an inner Data class for the nested data structure. Removed unused import `Any`.
