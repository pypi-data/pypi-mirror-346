Refactored SetGroupPortraitReq to include group_id (str | int) and file (str) fields based on OpenAPI spec. Added descriptions and made fields required. Created SetGroupPortraitResData nested model for the 'data' field in the response. Refactored SetGroupPortraitRes to include status, retcode, data (using nested model), message, wording, and echo (str | None) fields with correct types, descriptions, and required status. Removed unused import `Any`. Ensured all fields use `Field` for descriptions and default values/required status.
