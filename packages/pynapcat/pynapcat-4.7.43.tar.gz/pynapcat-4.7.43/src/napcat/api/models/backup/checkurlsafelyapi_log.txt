Analyzing the provided OpenAPI spec and the original Python code. The OpenAPI spec for `/check_url_safely` shows an empty request body and an empty success response body (`{}`). The original code correctly reflects this with `pass` in both `CheckUrlSafelyReq` and `CheckUrlSafelyRes`. 

Fixes applied:
1. Removed unused import `Any`.
2. Removed `logging` import and `logger` instance as they are not part of the model definition.
3. Removed `# type: ignore` comments as they are unnecessary.
4. Removed placeholder comments and boilerplate text.
5. Added simple docstrings to the request and response models.
6. Kept the `CheckUrlSafelyAPI` class as it was in the original code and seems intended for API mapping.
