Based on the OpenAPI specification for `/set_group_remark`, I have updated the `SetGroupRemarkReq` model to include the required fields `group_id` (string) and `remark` (string) with appropriate `Field` definitions. I have also updated the `SetGroupRemarkRes` model to match the specified response structure, including `status` (literal 'ok'), `retcode` (number/int), `data` (None), `message` (string), `wording` (string), and `echo` (string | None), using `Field` with descriptions and required markers (`...`). Unused import `Any` has been removed. The `# type: ignore` comments were removed as types are now correctly defined. The API metadata and the `SetGroupRemarkAPI` class structure remain largely the same as they were already correct according to standard patterns.
