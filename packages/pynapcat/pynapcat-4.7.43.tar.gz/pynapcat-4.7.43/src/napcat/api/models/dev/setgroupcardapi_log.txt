Based on the OpenAPI spec for `/set_group_card`, I have refactored the Pydantic models.

**SetGroupCardReq:**
- Added `group_id` and `user_id` fields with type `int | str` (as per `oneOf` in spec).
- Added `card` field with type `str | None` and a default of `None` (as it's optional). Added description.
- Marked `group_id` and `user_id` as required in the model definition by not providing a default value other than Field(...).
- Added descriptions to all fields using `Field`.

**SetGroupCardRes:**
- Added `status` field with type `Literal['ok']`.
- Added `retcode` field with type `int`.
- Added `data` field with type `None` (as per the response schema override). Added a default of `None`.
- Added `message` field with type `str`.
- Added `wording` field with type `str`.
- Added `echo` field with type `str | None` and a default of `None`.
- Added descriptions to all fields using `Field`.
- Removed the placeholder comment.
- No nested class needed for `data` as it's explicitly `null` in the response.

**General:**
- Removed unused imports (`logging`, `Any`).
- Ensured type hints use `|` for `Union` and `Optional`.
- Ensured all fields have descriptions and appropriate defaults or are marked required via `Field(...)`.
- Removed `type: ignore` comments.
- Updated comments and docstrings.
