Refactoring the Python code based on the OpenAPI specification and coding guidelines:
1. Removed unused import `typing.Any`.
2. Updated class descriptions.
3. Ensured `BotExitReq` and `BotExitRes` models correctly represent empty objects (`{}`) as per the OpenAPI spec using `pass`.
4. Removed `type: ignore` comments.
5. Kept the `BotExitAPI` class structure as it seems to be part of the internal framework, ensuring type hints are correct for Pydantic v2 (`type[BaseModel]` is appropriate).
6. No nested models or enums were required based on the provided OpenAPI schema.
