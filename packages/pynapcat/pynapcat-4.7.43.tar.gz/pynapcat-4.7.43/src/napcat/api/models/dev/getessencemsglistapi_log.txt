Based on the OpenAPI specification, I have updated the Python Pydantic models. The GetEssenceMsgListReq model now includes the required 'group_id' field which can be an int or string. The GetEssenceMsgListRes model has been fully implemented to match the response structure, including nested models for the 'data' array items and the 'content' array, handling both text and image message segments. Type annotations have been added or corrected using standard built-in types. Unused imports have been removed. Literal types are used for fixed string values like 'status' and message segment types. Field descriptions are added based on the OpenAPI documentation.
