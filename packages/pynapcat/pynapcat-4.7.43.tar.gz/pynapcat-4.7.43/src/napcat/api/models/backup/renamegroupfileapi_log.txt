Refactoring `RenameGroupFileReq` based on OpenAPI spec. Added fields `group_id` (int | str), `file_id` (str), `current_parent_directory` (str), `new_name` (str). Marked all as required and added descriptions. Refactoring `RenameGroupFileRes`. Created inner `Data` model with `ok` (bool). Added root fields `status` (str, default 'ok'), `retcode` (int), `data` (Data model), `message` (str), `wording` (str), `echo` (str | None). Added descriptions for all fields. Removed unused imports (`logging`, `Any`). Reviewed `RenameGroupFileAPI` - kept as is. Applied Pydantic v2 guidelines for type hints and Field usage.
