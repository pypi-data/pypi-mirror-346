Sofar is maybe the most complete Python package for the SOFA file format so
far. SOFA files store spatially distributed acoustic data such as impulse
responses or transfer functions. They are defined by the AES69-2022 standard
(see references). These are the key features of sofar

- Read, edit, and write SOFA files
- Add custom attributes to SOFA files
- Full Verification of the content of a SOFA files against AES69-2022
- Upgrade data that uses outdated SOFA conventions
- Open license allows unrestricted use
- sofar is tested using continuous integration on
- Uses a complete definition of the AES69-2022 standard (see references) maintained at [sofa_conventions](https://github.com/pyfar/sofa_conventions)

Getting Started
===============

The [sofar and SOFA notebook](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/interactive/sofar_introduction.html)
gives an overview of the most important sofar functionality and is a good starting point. For processing and visualizing data
inside SOFA files, we recommend the [pyfar package](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io) that can read SOFA files through
`pyfar.io.read_sofa` and the in-depth examples contained in the
[pyfar example gallery](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_gallery.html). Check out
[read the docs](https://sofar.readthedocs.io) for a complete documentation of sofar. A more detailed introduction to the SOFA
file format is given by Majdak et. al. 2022 (see references below). All information is also bundled at [pyfar.org](https://pyfar.org).

Installation
============

Use pip to install sofar

    pip install sofar


(Requires Python >= 3.8)

If the installation fails, please check out the [help section](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help).
