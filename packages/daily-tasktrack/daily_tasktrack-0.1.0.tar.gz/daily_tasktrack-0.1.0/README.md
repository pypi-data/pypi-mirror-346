# TaskTrack

**TaskTrack** is a simple YAML-based task time tracker for grouping daily tasks under named categories. It provides a command-line interface to add, list, and delete tasks with time accumulation and optional summaries.

## Features

* âœ… Add or update time on a task under a specific group
* âœ… Store tasks under `dailyTasks` in the YAML backend
* âœ… Optional summaries for each task
* âœ… List all tasks for a group, showing time and summary
* âœ… Delete tasks
* ðŸ“¦ Installable as a Python package with a `tasktrack` CLI
* ðŸ§ª Unit-tested with pytest, with isolated I/O fixtures

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the `tasktrack` command from anywhere.

### Add or update a task

```bash
tasktrack add <group>/<task> <time> [--summary "Your summary"]
```

* `<group>`: e.g. `a`, `b`, etc.
* `<task>`: the task name (no spaces recommended)
* `<time>`: time to add, in minutes (`Xm`) or hours (`Xh`)
* `--summary`: optional summary string

**Example:**

```bash
tasktrack add a/testtask 15m --summary "Refactored manager logic"
```

### List tasks in a group

```bash
tasktrack list <group>
```

**Example:**

```bash
tasktrack list a
```

Output:

```
- testtask: 15m â€” Refactored manager logic
- other: 30m
```

### Delete a task

```bash
tasktrack delete <group>/<task>
```

**Example:**

```bash
tasktrack delete a/testtask
```

## Configuration

By default, the YAML database is stored in `task_tracker/tasks.yaml`. To override:

```bash
export TASK_TRACKER_DB=/path/to/custom_tasks.yaml
```

## Testing

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
