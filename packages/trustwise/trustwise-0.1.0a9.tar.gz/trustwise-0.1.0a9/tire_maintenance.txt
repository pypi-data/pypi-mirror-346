## Chapter 4: Tire Maintenance and Safety

### Introduction to Tire Care
Proper tire maintenance is essential for vehicle safety, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity. This chapter covers the fundamental aspects of tire care that every vehicle owner should know.

### Tire Pressure Management

#### Checking Tire Pressure
To check your tire pressure, you'll need a tire pressure gauge. These can be purchased at auto parts stores and service stations for as little as $1-7. They typically come in three types:
- Pen-sized tire pressure gauges
- Digital tire pressure gauges
- Dial tire pressure gauges with hoses

Follow these steps to properly check tire pressure:
1. Remove the valve cap from each tire
2. Align the gauge up to the valve
3. Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release
4. For pen gauges, you'll see the measuring stick pushed out displaying the pressure reading
5. Fill the tire with air if needed, then recheck until you reach the desired pressure

#### Optimal Tire Pressure
The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle can be found:
- On a sticker in the driver's door jamb
- In the vehicle owner's manual
- Sometimes on the inside of the fuel filler door

Most passenger vehicles have a recommended pressure between 32-35 PSI (pounds per square inch). Never use the maximum pressure listed on the tire sidewall as your target - this is the maximum the tire can hold, not the recommended pressure.

### Tire Tread Inspection

#### The Penny Test
A simple way to check your tire tread depth is with a penny:
1. Insert a penny into the tread groove with Lincoln's head upside down
2. If you can see the top of Lincoln's head, your tread is less than 2/32" and the tire needs replacement
3. Check multiple spots across each tire

#### Wear Patterns
Uneven tire wear can indicate problems with alignment, inflation, or suspension:
- Center wear: Overinflation
- Edge wear: Underinflation
- One-sided wear: Alignment issues
- Cupping or scalloping: Suspension problems

### Tire Rotation

Tires should be rotated every 5,000-7,000 miles to ensure even wear and maximize lifespan. The rotation pattern depends on your vehicle:
- Forward Cross: For front-wheel drive vehicles
- Rearward Cross: For rear-wheel and 4-wheel drive vehicles
- X-Pattern: Alternative for any drive type

### Wheel Alignment

Proper wheel alignment ensures your vehicle handles correctly and prevents premature tire wear. There are three primary alignment angles:
- Camber: The inward or outward tilt of the tire when viewed from the front
- Toe: Whether the tires point inward or outward when viewed from above
- Caster: The forward or backward tilt of the steering axis

Signs you need an alignment include:
- Vehicle pulling to one side
- Uneven or rapid tire wear
- Crooked steering wheel when driving straight
- Squealing tires

### Seasonal Considerations

#### Winter Tires
In regions with regular snow and ice, winter tires provide superior traction below 45Â°F. They use special rubber compounds that remain flexible in cold temperatures and have tread patterns designed to grip snow and slush.

#### All-Season vs. Summer Tires
All-season tires offer a compromise between summer and winter performance but excel at neither. Summer tires provide better dry and wet traction in warm conditions but become dangerously hard below freezing temperatures.

### Tire Aging and Replacement

Even with adequate tread, tires should be replaced every 6-10 years due to rubber degradation. Find the tire's age by locating the DOT code on the sidewall - the last four digits indicate the week and year of manufacture (e.g., "2618" means the 26th week of 2018).

### Emergency Situations

#### Handling a Blowout
If you experience a tire blowout:
1. Maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel
2. Don't slam on the brakes
3. Let the car slow down gradually
4. Pull to the shoulder when safe

#### Changing a Flat Tire
Basic steps for changing a flat tire:
1. Find a safe location away from traffic
2. Apply the parking brake and use wheel chocks
3. Loosen lug nuts before jacking up the car
4. Raise the vehicle with the jack at the designated lift point
5. Remove lug nuts and tire
6. Mount the spare tire and hand-tighten lug nuts
7. Lower the vehicle and tighten lug nuts in a star pattern
8. Check the spare tire pressure when possible

### Eco-Friendly Tire Disposal

Old tires should never be sent to landfills. Options for proper disposal include:
- Recycling at tire retailers (most offer this service for a small fee)
- Municipal recycling programs
- Specialized tire recycling centers

Recycled tires can be used for playground surfaces, rubberized asphalt, and other products.
