# Overview

This is a brute feed parser.

Reasons:

 - feedparser does not parse everything. I can vividly recall that it could not parse something
 - does not parse CDATA correctly (at least what I remember)
 - there were some problems with using it in threads (async functions). There was some warning, or error

This project aims to be a drop-in replacement for [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)

# Standards? What standards?

This project does not care about standards. Standards are for loosers. 

Look at me! I am the standard now!

# Disclaimer

This project contains code so questionable that at least one line could cause Linus Torvalds to spontaneously combust.

Reading the code in large doses may result in dizziness, despair, or the sudden realization that tabs vs. spaces was the least of your problems.

Keep the code far away from any seasoned kernel developers.

Pasting any part of this into a Linux kernel mailing list may trigger several years of flame wars, philosophical debates, and intergenerational feuds among programming factions.

Proceed with caution. Or better yet — just don’t.
