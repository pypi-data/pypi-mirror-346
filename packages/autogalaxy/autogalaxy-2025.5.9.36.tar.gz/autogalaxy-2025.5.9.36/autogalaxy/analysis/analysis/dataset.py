        Abstract Analysis class for all model-fits which fit galaxies to a dataset, like imaging or interferometer data.

        This class stores the settings used to perform the model-fit for certain components of the model (e.g. a
        pixelization or inversion), the Cosmology used for the analysis and adapt images used for certain model
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The dataset that is the model is fitted too.
        adapt_image_maker
            Makes the adapt-model image and galaxies images of a previous result in a model-fitting pipeline, which are
            used by certain classes for adapting the analysis to the properties of the dataset.
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted during the model-fit, for example which linear algebra
            formalism is used.
        title_prefix
            A string that is added before the title of all figures output by visualization, for example to
            put the name of the dataset and galaxy in the title.

        """
        It is common for the model to have components whose parameters are all fixed, and thus the way that component
        fits the data does not change. For example, if all parameter associated with the light profiles of galaxies
        in the model are fixed, the image generated from these galaxies will not change irrespective of the model
        parameters chosen by the non-linear search.

        Preloading exploits this to speed up the log likelihood function, by inspecting the model and storing in memory
        quantities that do not change. For the example above, the image of all galaxies would be stored in memory and
        to perform every fit in the `log_likelihood_funtion`.

        This function sets up all preload quantities, which are described fully in the `preloads` modules. This
        occurs directly before the non-linear search begins, to ensure the model parameterization is fixed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            The paths object which manages all paths, e.g. where the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.
        model
            The model object, which includes model components representing the galaxies that are fitted to
            the imaging data.

        Before the model-fit via the non-linear search begins, this routine saves attributes of the `Analysis` object
        to the `files` folder such that they can be loaded after the analysis using PyAutoFit's database and aggregator
        tools.

        For this analysis the following are output:

        - The settings associated with the inversion.
        - The settings associated with the pixelization.
        - The Cosmology.

        The following .fits files are also output via the plotter interface:

        - The mask applied to the dataset, in the `PrimaryHDU` of `dataset.fits`.
        - The dataset (data / noise-map / over sampler / etc.).
        - The adapt image's model image and galaxy images, if used.

        It is common for these attributes to be loaded by many of the template aggregator functions given in the
        `aggregator` modules. For example, when using the database tools to reperform a fit, this will by default
        load the dataset, settings and other attributes necessary to perform a fit using the attributes output by
        this function.
