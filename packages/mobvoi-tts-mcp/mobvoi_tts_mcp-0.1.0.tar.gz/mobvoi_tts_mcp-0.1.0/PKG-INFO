<p align="center">
  Official Mobvoi TTS <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server that enables interaction with Mobvoi powerful Text to Speech, Voice Clone APIs. This server allows MCP clients like <a href="https://www.cursor.so">Cursor</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">Claude Desktop</a>, <a href="https://cline.bot/">Cline</a> </a> and other Client to generate speech, clone voices, and more.
</p>

## Prerequisite

1. python 3.10+;
2. Get your APP_KEY and APP_SECRET from [Mobvoi Sequence Monkey open platform](https://openapi.moyin.com/user/mine-app-detail). New users can claim a free quota.
3. Install `uv` (Python package manager), install with `pip install uv` or see the `uv` [repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for additional install methods.

## Quickstart with Cursor

Go to Cursor -> Cursor Settings -> MCP, click `Add new global MCP server`, and mcp.json will open, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
      },
```

## Quickstart with Claude Desktop

Go to Claude Desktop -> Settings -> Developer, click `Edit Config` and open `claude_desktop_config.json`, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
      },
```

## Quickstart with Cline

Install Cline extension on VSCode EXTENSIONS, and go to Cline -> MCP Servers -> Installed, click `Config MCP Servers` and  `cline_mcp_settings.json` will be opened, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
        "transportType": "stdio"
      },
```

For MacOS and Linux systems, you can refer to the above for configuration. We haven't tested the Windows system yet.

## Source Code Test

If you want to conduct tests based on the source code or perform secondary development based on this repository, you can configure it in the following way:

```
"MobvoiTTSLocal": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path-to-mobvoi_tts-mcp>/mobvoi_tts_mcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
      },
      "transportType": "stdio"
    },
```

Take Cline as an example, and the configuration of other clients is similar.

## Example usage

1. Try cloning a voice from your audio file(local or remote), enter the following content in the Cursor agent mode: "[https://tc-nj-backend-pub-cdn.mobvoi.com/subtitles/wav/9e5d439e0e9142966037fb80fe9e0d8e.wav](https://tc-nj-backend-pub-cdn.mobvoi.com/subtitles/wav/9e5d439e0e9142966037fb80fe9e0d8e.wav), clone this voice"
2. Specify the speaker, synthesize speech from the text and play it aloud. Prompt the model like the following: "Use the sound cloned just now to broadcast: 'Welcome to experience Mobvoi TTS MCP."
3. A demonstration video:

## Troubleshooting

### spawn uvx ENOENT

If you encounter the error "MCP Mobvoi TTS: spawn uvx ENOENT", confirm its absolute path by running this command in your terminal:
`which uvx`
Once you obtain the absolute path (e.g., /usr/local/bin/uvx), update your configuration to use that path (e.g., "command": "/usr/local/bin/uvx"). This ensures that the correct executable is referenced.

### MCP error -32001: Request timed out

If you encounter this error, this indicates that there is a problem with your network. If you are in mainland China, we strongly recommend that you configure extra pypi sources in the following way:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        ...
        "args": [
          "--index", 
          "https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple",
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
       ...
      },
```

Note that the extra pypi source needs to be configured at the very front of the args.
