This server allows MCP clients like <a href="https://www.cursor.so">Cursor</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">Claude Desktop</a>, <a href="https://cline.bot/">Cline</a> </a> and other Client to generate speech, clone voices, and more. The mobvoi-tts-mcp server is built based on Python. Our PyPI package is published at Pypi, you can click on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mobvoi-tts-mcp/">Pypi</a> to view the latest version..
</p>

## Prerequisite

1. python 3.10+;
2. Get your APP_KEY and APP_SECRET from [Mobvoi Sequence Monkey open platform](https://openapi.moyin.com/user/mine-app-detail). New users can claim a free quota.
3. Install `uv` (Python package manager), install with `pip install uv` or see the `uv` [repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for additional install methods.

## Quickstart with Cursor

Go to Cursor -> Cursor Settings -> MCP, click `Add new global MCP server`, and mcp.json will open, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
      },
```

## Quickstart with Claude Desktop

Go to Claude Desktop -> Settings -> Developer, click `Edit Config` and open `claude_desktop_config.json`, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
      },
```

## Quickstart with Cline

Install Cline extension on VSCode EXTENSIONS, and go to Cline -> MCP Servers -> Installed, click `Config MCP Servers` and  `cline_mcp_settings.json` will be opened, paste the following config content:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
        },
        "transportType": "stdio"
      },
```

For MacOS and Linux systems, you can refer to the above for configuration. We haven't tested the Windows system yet.

## Source Code Test

If you want to conduct tests based on the source code or perform secondary development based on this repository, you can configure it in the following way:

```
"MobvoiTTSLocal": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path-to-mobvoi_tts-mcp>/mobvoi_tts_mcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
          "APP_KEY": "<insert-your-APP_KEY-here>",
          "APP_SECRET": "<insert-your-APP_SECRET-here>"
      },
      "transportType": "stdio"
    },
```

Take Cline as an example, and the configuration of other clients is similar.

## Example usage

1. Try cloning a voice from your audio file(local or remote), enter the following content in the Cursor agent mode: "[https://tc-nj-backend-pub-cdn.mobvoi.com/subtitles/wav/9e5d439e0e9142966037fb80fe9e0d8e.wav](https://tc-nj-backend-pub-cdn.mobvoi.com/subtitles/wav/9e5d439e0e9142966037fb80fe9e0d8e.wav), clone this voice"
2. Specify the speaker, synthesize speech from the text and play it aloud. Prompt the model like the following: "Use the sound cloned just now to broadcast: 'Welcome to experience Mobvoi TTS MCP."
3. A demonstration video:

## Troubleshooting

### spawn uvx ENOENT

If you encounter the error "MCP Mobvoi TTS: spawn uvx ENOENT", confirm its absolute path by running this command in your terminal:
`which uvx`
Once you obtain the absolute path (e.g., /usr/local/bin/uvx), update your configuration to use that path (e.g., "command": "/usr/local/bin/uvx"). This ensures that the correct executable is referenced.

### MCP error -32001: Request timed out

If you encounter this error, this indicates that there is a problem with your network. If you are in mainland China, we strongly recommend that you configure extra pypi sources in the following way:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        ...
        "args": [
          "--index", 
          "https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple",
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
       ...
      },
```

Note that the extra pypi source needs to be configured at the very front of the args.

### Unable to synchronize the latest PyPI package

If you encounter this situation, it may be due to network issues or the cache of the PyPI packages. You can clear the cached PyPI packages and configure the mirror source at the same time. It's like this:

```
"MobvoiTTS": {
        ...
        "args": [
          "--upgrade",
          "--no-cache-dir",
          "--index", 
          "https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple",
          "mobvoi-tts-mcp"
        ],
       ...
      },
```
