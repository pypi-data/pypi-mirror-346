sensor_positions,HOR.VER,"The combined value of the horizontal and vertical location indices specified in each data file name. The HOR index is a three-character alphanumeric code for the measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if one surface measurement were made at each of five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. The VER index is a three-character alphanumeric code for the measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if one temperature measurement is made at each vertical level of a tower with 8 levels, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080.",string,NA,basic,asIs
