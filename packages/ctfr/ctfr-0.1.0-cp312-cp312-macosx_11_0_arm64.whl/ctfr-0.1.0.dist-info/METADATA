## Documentation

See the ctfr [documentation](https://ctfr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about the package, including usage examples and the API reference.

---

## Instalation

### Using PyPI

The latest stable release is available on PyPI, and can be installed with the following command:

```shell
pip install ctfr
```

Note that this doesn’t install the plotting dependencies. To install with plotting included, run

```shell
pip install ctfr[display]
```

### Development mode

If you want to make changes to ctfr, you can install it in editable mode with development dependencies by cloning or downloading the repository and running:

```shell
make dev
```

or

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

When installing in this mode, Cython is a build dependency. If you have trouble running Cython, see [this guide](https://docs.cython.org/en/stable/src/quickstart/install.html).

Note: When developing, `.pyx` files need to be recompiled in order for changes in them to take place. This can be done by running 

```shell
make ext
```

or

```shell
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
