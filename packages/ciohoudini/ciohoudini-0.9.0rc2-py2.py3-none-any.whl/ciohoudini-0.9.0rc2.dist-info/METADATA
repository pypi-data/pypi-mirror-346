# Conductor for Houdini

A ROP to submit work from Houdini to Conductor's cloud. Compatible with Python3 versions of Houdini for all platforms. Available to beta customers. Contact us!


## Install

**To install the latest version.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade ciohoudini --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**To install a specific version, for example 0.1.0.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ciohoudini==0.1.0 --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**Then setup the Houdini module.** 

```bash
python ~/Conductor/ciohoudini/post_install.py
```

> **NOTE** An alternative is to install from the Plugins page in the [Conductor Companion app](https://docs.conductortech.com/getting_started/installation/#companion-app)

## Usage

Create a ConductorJob Rop and attach a render nodes. Use the Conductor->Submit menu item to submit several jobs, or press the Submit button in a job's properties panel.

## Changelog

## Version:0.9.0-rc.2 -- 07 May 2025
* Improved asset scanning


## Version:0.9.0-rc.1 -- 21 Apr 2025
* Revision to Render Script


## Version:0.9.0-rc.0 -- 18 Apr 2025
Improved asset scanning by skipping unnecessary asset loading


## Version:0.8.0-rc.8 -- 10 Apr 2025
* Forced verbose log level to 9 on USD Render ROP to ensure consistent logging.


## Version:0.8.0-rc.3 -- 28 Feb 2025
* Enhancing Houdini Simulations


## Version:0.7.17-rc.1 -- 25 Nov 2024
* Implemented USD dependency scraping to enhance asset detection and path resolution.


## Version:0.7.15 -- 20 Aug 2024
* LOPs node reference is now included in scraping
* Added instance type best fit logic
* Evaluates variable values, such as HIP in the output path parameter, ensuring they are dynamically resolved instead of being treated as literal strings.
* Removed redundant Not a drive letter. Skipping messages to streamline output and improve clarity.
* Enhanced the submitter to comprehensively print all potential output paths for each ROP, including direct parameters, USD stage attributes, environment variables, custom logic, and various dynamic cases. This ensures that all possible output locations are identified and displayed for complex rendering setups.


## Version:0.7.12 -- 12 Jul 2024

## Version:0.7.1 -- 16 Jun 2023

* Adds support for redshift and karma.

### Version:0.6.0 -- 25 May 2023

* Adding fml feature. [7458b95]

### Version:0.5.3 -- 15 Dec 2022

* Fix a bug where the driver path expression in the HDA went missing. [678adc5]

### Version:0.5.2 -- 14 Dec 2022

* Adds arnold logging and turns on abort-on-license-fail and other render configurations. [e5cc088]

### Version:0.5.1 -- 09 Dec 2022

* Adds the ability to define a Unix style wildcard list of filename patterns to be excluded from the asset scan. [05a020b]

### Version:0.5.0 -- 07 Dec 2022

* Adds a button to export an executable submission script without actually submitting it. [ff43928]

### Version:0.4.13 -- 06 Oct 2022

* Use faster ciopath. [1bcffb1]
* Use host version for hserver hack. [c9bfcf0]

### Version:0.4.12 -- 23 Sep 2022

* Resolves JOB varaiable, op:, and temp: tokens. 
* Adds a version guard for the hserver licensing hack so that it only affects 18.5.X and doesn't break 19.X. [ca6fe54]

### Version:0.4.11 -- 23 Sep 2022

* Remove circular dependency. [1db1374]

### Version:0.4.10 -- 20 Jul 2022

* The default dependency scraping algorithm has been tightened up in order to avoid accidentally scraping the home directory. [cef8338]

* Adds a convenient button to copy the render script to shared location. This is useful if an uploader daemon is running on a machine that does not have access to the Conductor installation. [abc8989]

* Adds a UI that allows you to add existing local environment variables to be set on the remote Linux render node. Any Windows path variables are converted to Posix paths. [fa83ba6]

* If the OCIO variable is set locally, it is added to the remote environment, and the containing folder is uploaded. [2b76b20]

* The convenience function to add HDAs to the asset list now adds the .hda files, and  not the entire folder, which could include several backup files.

* Ensure that any assets that happen to be found in the output folder are excluded from the upload.

* If file references are found to have relative paths, we now tests to see if they exist in the HIP folder, and if not, we don't upload them. If they just happen to found in the folder where Houdini was invoked from, then we treat them as missing and ignore them.

* If file references are found to be internal to Houdini (op:... temp:... etc.) then we ignore them. 

### Version:0.4.8 -- 19 Jul 2022

* The asset-scan regular expression now detects any tokens between angle brackets, even custom tokens like `<OBJ_NAME>` It also allows for more variation of delimiters around number expressions, such as `_###_` or `.###-` etc. [d2235eb]

### Version:0.4.7 -- 19 Jul 2022

* Implement a pathmapping function in chrender which will turn Windows paths into Posix paths. [a7b84f2]

* Turn off the CONDUCTOR_PATHHELPER variable for all submissions. [7c616de]
