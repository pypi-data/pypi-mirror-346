flufl.i18n - A high level API for internationalization
======================================================

This package is called ``flufl.i18n``.  It provides a high level, convenient
API for managing internationalization translation contexts in Python
application.  There is a simple API for single-context applications, such as
command line scripts which only need to translate into one language during the
entire course of their execution.  There is a more flexible, but still
convenient API for multi-context applications, such as servers, which may need
to switch language contexts for different tasks.


Requirements
============

``flufl.i18n`` requires Python 3.8 or newer.


Documentation
=============

A `simple guide`_ to using the library is available, along with a detailed
`API reference`_.
