Managing device profiles
========================

A device profile stores device information including general information, models, 
supported connection methods, and you can connecct the profile with related YANG files.

Defining a device profile
-------------------------

1. From the sidebar on any YANG Suite page, select "Setup → Device profiles".
2. On the newly loaded page, select "New Profile."
   A form will appear for you to enter the device information into.
3. Enter a name for this device profile.
4. Fill in all of the required fields under "General device information."
   The address, username, and password you enter here will be used as
   default values for any specific connection method (SSH, NETCONF, etc.).
5. For "Device supports the following," check all of the connection methods
   that your device supports (SSH, NETCONF, etc.)
6. Each of these methods will use method-specific defaults
   (e.g., port 22 for SSH) plus the parameters you entered under
   "General device information." If you want to change any of these defaults,
   select the appropriate tab (such as "NETCONF")
   to display its options, and make changes as needed to override the
   inherited defaults.
7. Once this is done, you may use the "Check connectivity" button
   to confirm that the device is reachable by ping and
   by the access mode(s) you have enabled.
   This will take a moment then report the results of this check.
   If any checks failed, you should investigate to determine why
   and make corrections to the device profile as needed.
8. Once you are satisfied that the device profile is properly
   defined, select "Save new device profile" to save this profile.
9. You can now use this saved profile wherever YANG Suite requires one,
   such as downloading YANG modules from a device or sending NETCONF RPCs
   to a device.

Setting up devices with FIPS mode enabled
-----------------------------------------

If the device has FIPS mode enabled, Your SSH & Netconf connections might get
rejected by the device. In such case, we can Generate a FIPS-compliant SSH key to
connect to the device with the following steps:

1. Check the current keys with the **show ssh key** command.
2. If an RSA key is present it must be removed with the **no ssh key rsa** configuration command.
3. Generate a FIPS-compliant SSH key with the **ssh key ecdsa 521 force** command.
4. Verify the status of the FIPS feature with the **show fips status** command::

     FIPS Status: enabled
     Switch Mode: FIPS
     ----------------------
     LC          STATUS
     ----------------------

Now you will be able to connect to your device via SSH & NETCONF.


Creating a Default Repository and Yangset
-----------------------------------------

When first setting up a device profile, the next step many users do is download
all YANG files from the new device creating a repository, and then creating a Yangset
carved out of the new repository.  By clicking on "Create Default Repository and Yangset"
the download begins, a repository is created, and a Yangset containing all the YANG
files in the repository is created.  This allows the user to go right to work with an
available Yangset.

Managing existing device profiles
---------------------------------

From the same "Setup → Device profiles" page,
you can manage the existing device profiles. Select any device profile from
the list on the right side of the page, and you can then re-check its
connectivity, make changes to it, clone it into a new device profile, or
delete it if no longer needed.

Setting up a device through a Jump Host
---------------------------------------

The username and password set in the General section should be associated to the
jump server. The usernames, passwords, and ports assigned to protocols will be
for the jump connection to the device. If the connection to the jump host is not successful,
the infrastructure will attempt to make a connection directly to the device using the
protocol settings.
