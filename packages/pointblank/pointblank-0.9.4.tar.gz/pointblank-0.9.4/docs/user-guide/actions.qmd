Actions are meant to be combined with thresholds and they allow you easily write text to the console
or execute custom functions. As an example, when testing a column for values that should always be
greater than `2` you might want some text emitted to the console when any failing test units are
found. To do that, you need to pair a threshold level with an associated action (and that action
could take the form of a console message).

## How Actions Work

Let's look at an example on how this works in practice. The following validation plan contains a
single step (using
[`col_vals_gt()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_gt.html)) where
the `thresholds=` and `actions=` parameters are set using
[`Thresholds`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Thresholds.html) and
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) calls:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

validation_1 = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"))
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="c",
        value=2,
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=5),
        actions=pb.Actions(warning="WARNING: failing test found.")
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_1
```

The code uses `thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=5)` to set a 'warning' threshold of `1` and
an 'error' threshold of `5` failing test units. The results part of the validation table shows that:

- The `FAIL` column shows that 3 tests units have failed
- The `W` column (short for 'warning') shows a filled gray circle indicating it's reached its
threshold level
- The `E` ('error') column shows an open yellow circle indicating it's below the threshold
level

More importantly, the text `"WARNING: failing test found."` has been emitted. Here it appears above
the validation table and that's because the action is executed eagerly during interrogation
(before the report has even been generated).

So, an action is executed for a particular condition (e.g., 'warning') within a validation step if
these three things are true:

1. there is a threshold set for that condition (either globally, or as part of that step)
2. there is an associated action set for the condition (again, either set globally or within the
step)
3. during interrogation, the threshold value for the condition was exceeded by the number or
proportion of failing test units

There is a lot of flexibility for setting both thresholds and actions and everything here is
considered optional. Put another way, you can set various thresholds and various actions as needed
and the interrogation phase will determine whether all the requirements are met for executing
an action.

## Expressing Actions with a String

There are a few options in how to define the actions:

1. **String**: a message to be displayed in the console
2. **Callable**: a function to be called
3. **List of Strings/Callables**: for execution of multiple messages or functions

The actions are executed at interrogation time when the threshold level assigned to the action
is exceeded by the number or proportion of failing test units. When providing a string, it will
simply be printed to the console. A callable will also be executed at the time of interrogation.
If providing a list of strings or callables, each item in the list will be executed in order.
Such a list can contain a mix of strings and callables.

Displaying console messages may be a simple approach, but it is effective. And the strings don't
have to be static, there are templating features that can be useful for constructing strings for a
variety of situations. The following placeholders are available for use:

- `{type}`: The validation step type where the action is executed (e.g., ‘col_vals_gt’, etc.)
- `{level}`: The threshold level where the action is executed (‘warning’, ‘error’, or ‘critical’)
- `{step}` or `{i}`: The step number in the validation workflow where the action is executed
- `{col}` or `{column}`: The column name where the action is executed
- `{val}` or `{value}`: An associated value for the validation method
- `{time}`: A datetime value for when the action was executed

Here's an example where we prepare a console message with a number of value placeholders
(`action_str`) and use it globally at `Actions(critical=)`:

```{python}
action_str = "[{LEVEL}: {TYPE}]: Step {step} has failed validation. ({time})"

validation_2 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
        actions=pb.Actions(critical=action_str),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.10
    )
    .col_vals_ge(
        columns="session_duration",
        value=15
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_2
```

What we get here are two messages in the console, corresponding to critical failures in steps 2 and
3. The placeholders were replaced with the correct text for the context. Note that some of the
resulting text is capitalized (e.g., `"CRITICAL"`, `"COL_VALS_GT"`, etc.) and this is because we
capitalized the placeholder text itself. Have a look at the documentation article of
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) for more details on this.

## Making Actions with Callables

Aside from strings, any callable can be used as an action value. Here's an example where we use a
custom function as part of an action:

```{python}
def duration_issue():
    from datetime import datetime

    print(f"Data quality issue found ({datetime.now()}).")


validation_3 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.05
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="session_duration",
        value=15,
        actions=pb.Actions(warning=duration_issue),
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_3
```

In this case, the 'warning' action is set to call the user's `dq_issue()` function. This action is
only executed when the 'warning' threshold is exceeded in step 3. Because all three thresholds are
exceeded in that step, the 'warning' action of executing the function occurs (resulting in a
message being printed to the console).

This is an example where actions can be defined locally for an individual validation step. The
global threshold setting applied to all three validation steps but the step-level action only
applied to step 3. You are free to mix and match both threshold and action settings at the global
level (i.e., set in the [`Validate`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.html)
call) or at the step level. The key thing to be aware of is that step-level settings of thresholds
and actions take precedence.

## Using `get_action_metadata()` to Access Metadata When Building an Action Callable

To access information about the validation step where an action was triggered, we can call
[`get_action_metadata()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_action_metadata.html)
in the body of a function to be used within `Actions`. The dictionary that's returned by that
function allows us to make more generalized actions that could react accordingly to different
failure states.

In the following example, we'll make a function called `print_problem()` that prints information to
the console about the failure state for a validation step. In this case, the action will be applied
to any threshold level being exceeded (by using `Actions(default=print_problem)`). And only the most
severe level exceeded per step will execute `print_problem()` since `Actions(highest_only=True)` by
default.

```{python}
def print_problem():
    m = pb.get_action_metadata()
    print(f"{m['level']} ({m['level_num']}) for Step {m['step']}: {m['failure_text']}")


validation = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
        actions=pb.Actions(default=print_problem),
        brief=True,
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.05
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="session_duration",
        value=15,
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation
```

We end up seeing two messages printed for failures in Steps 2 and 3. And though those steps had more
than one threshold exceeded, only the most severe level in each yielded a console message.

Alse note that we set the action in `Validate(actions=)` so that the action would apply to all
validation steps where thresholds are exceeded. This obviated the need to set `actions=` at every
validation step (though you can do this as a local override, even setting `actions=None` to disable
globally set actions).

The metadata dictionary contains the following fields for a given validation step:

- `step`: The step number.
- `column`: The column name.
- `value`: The value being compared (only available in certain validation steps).
- `type`: The assertion type (e.g., `"col_vals_gt"`, etc.).
- `time`: The time the validation step was executed (in ISO format).
- `level`: The severity level (`"warning"`, `"error"`, or `"critical"`).
- `level_num`: The severity level as a numeric value (`30`, `40`, or `50`).
- `autobrief`: A localized and brief statement of the expectation for the step.
- `failure_text`: Localized text that explains how the validation step failed.

## Final Actions with `FinalActions`

When you need to execute actions after all validation steps are complete, Pointblank provides the
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html) class. Unlike
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) which triggers on a
per-step basis during the validation process,
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html) executes after
the entire validation is complete, giving you a way to respond to the overall validation results.

Here's how to use
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html):

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

def send_alert():
    summary = pb.get_validation_summary()
    if summary["highest_severity"] == "critical":
        print(f"ALERT: Critical validation failures found in `{summary['tbl_name']}`")

validation_with_final = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        tbl_name="game_revenue",
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
        final_actions=pb.FinalActions(
            "Validation complete.",  # a string message
            send_alert               # a callable function
        )
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.10
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_with_final
```

In this example:

- We define the function `send_alert()` that checks the validation summary for critical failures
- We provide a simple string message `"Validation complete."` that will print to the console
- Both actions will execute in order after all validation steps have completed

Because the 'critical' threshold was exceeded in Step 2, we see the printed alert of `send_alert()`
after the simple string message.

### Creating Final Actions

[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html) accepts any
number of actions as positional arguments. Each argument can be:

1. **String**: A message to be displayed in the console
2. **Callable**: A function to be called with no arguments
3. **List of Strings/Callables**: Multiple actions to execute in sequence

All actions will be executed in the order they are provided after all validation steps have
completed.

### Using `get_validation_summary()` in Final Actions

When creating a callable function to use with
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html), you can access
information about the overall validation results using the
[`get_validation_summary()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_validation_summary.html)
function. This gives you a dictionary with comprehensive information about the validation:

```python
def comprehensive_report():
    summary = pb.get_validation_summary()
    print(f"Validation Report for {summary['tbl_name']}:")
    print(f"- Steps: {summary['n_steps']}")
    print(f"- Passing steps: {summary['n_passing_steps']}")
    print(f"- Failing steps: {summary['n_failing_steps']}")

    # Take additional actions based on results
    if summary["n_failing_steps"] > 0:
        # Create and execute a Slack notification
        notify = pb.send_slack_notification(
            webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url",
            summary_msg="""
            🚨 *Validation Failure Alert*
            • Table: {tbl_name}
            • Failed Steps: {n_failing_steps} of {n_steps}
            • Highest Severity: {highest_severity}
            • Time: {time}
            """,
        )
        notify()  # Execute the notification function


validation = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        tbl_name="game_revenue",
        final_actions=pb.FinalActions(comprehensive_report),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.05
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation
```

```{python}
# | echo: false

validation = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        tbl_name="game_revenue",
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.05
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation
```

Here we used the [`send_slack_notification()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/send_slack_notification.html)
function, which is available in Pointblank as a pre-built action. It can be used by itself in
`final_actions=` but here it's integrated into the user's `comprehensive_report()` function.

### Combining the Two Types of Actions

You can use both [`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) and
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html) together for
comprehensive validation control:

```{python}
def log_step_failure():
    m = pb.get_action_metadata()
    print(f"Step {m['step']} failed with {m['level']}")


def generate_summary():
    summary = pb.get_validation_summary()
    # Sum up total failed test units across all steps
    total_failed = sum(summary["dict_n_failed"].values())
    # Sum up total test units across all steps
    total_units = sum(summary["dict_n"].values())
    print(f"Validation complete: {total_failed} failures out of {total_units} tests")


validation_combined = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10),
        actions=pb.Actions(default=log_step_failure),
        final_actions=pb.FinalActions(generate_summary),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(
        columns="player_id",
        pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="item_revenue",
        value=0.05
    )
    .interrogate()
)
```

This approach allows you to:

1. Log individual step failures during the validation process using
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html)
2. Generate a comprehensive report after all validation steps are complete using
[`FinalActions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/FinalActions.html)

Using both action types gives you fine-grained control over when and how notifications and other
actions are triggered in your validation workflow.
