# GitLab Schedule Badge

The following project provides the means to generate badges based on
the status of a GitLab project's scheduled job. This tool can be used to
host a website that presents users the option to pass in a GitLab project
URL. Users can then request available scheduled pipelines for the project
and the page will provide badge links that can be used in other
documentation.

## Requirements

* [Python][python] 3.11+
* [Flask][flask]
* [Requests][requests]
* [pybadges2][pybadges2]
* WSGI-compatible web server

## Installation

### Manual

This tool can be installed using [pip][pip]:

```shell
pip install gitlab-schedule-badge
 (or)
python -m pip install gitlab-schedule-badge
```

For an initial setup/testing, users can start the application from the
command line:

```shell
gitlab-schedule-badge --help
 (or)
python -m gitlab_schedule_badge --help
```

Running the instance will require a configuration to be prepared (discussed
below).

When looking to deploy this tool for production use, there are
[various ways to use this application][flask-deploying]. This application
uses the following for WSGI startup:

- Module: `gitlab_schedule_badge.wsgi`
- Call: `main`

For example, users can use [Gunicorn][gunicorn] as follows:

```
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0 "gitlab_schedule_badge.wsgi:main()"
```

### Docker

This project supports multiple ways to use this utility inside a Docker
environment. A recommended choice is to use a pre-built image available
from GitLab's container registry.

### Pre-built image

A pre-built image can be acquired using the following command:

```
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-schedule-badge/gitlab-schedule-badge:0.4.0
```

Prepare a configuration for this container by creating a file
`/etc/gitlab-schedule-badge.toml` with the contents defined in the
[configuration template][config-template] (users can use any path or
filename they desire, as long as the following `docker run` command
points to this file). Adjust these options to the configuration desired.

The container than can be run using the following command:

```
docker run \
    --name gitlab-schedule-badge \
    --detach \
    --publish 8080:8000 \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --volume /etc/gitlab-schedule-badge.toml:/etc/gitlab-schedule-badge.toml \
    registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-schedule-badge/gitlab-schedule-badge:0.4.0
```

Feel free to change the value of `8080` to a more preferred port value.

#### Self-managed Docker Compose

Users can also take advantage of the Docker compose definition. First, copy
the contents in this repository's `docker/` folder to a desired location.

Next, load up the container using `docker compose` from within the folder:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up --detach
```

Both Docker build calls will by default load a container with the
PyPI version of `gitlab-schedule-badge`. Users wanting to use the local
implementation in their container can do so by performing a Docker
build with the `--build-arg local` argument.

For example:

```
docker compose build --build-arg BUILD_MODE=local
docker compose up --detach
```

## Configuration

Configuration is performed using a `gitlab-schedule-badge.toml` file.

An example of a bare minimum configuration is as follows:

```
[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]
url = 'https://git.example.com/'
token = 'glpat-value'
```

1. Define a GitLab instance with the `[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]`
   section.
2. Specifies the GitLab instance that API requests will be made to.
3. Specifies the [token][tokens] used to authenticate API requests.

The token can be either a personal access token, a project access token
or a group access token. Only projects which the token has access to can
query the scheduled pipeline information for said projects. A token only
requires the `read_api` scope. For project/group access tokens, only the
`Guest` role is required if the project is public. For private
projects/groups, a role of `Reporter` may be required.

Multiple instances can be added by adding additional instance sections.
For example, the following configuration supports querying projects from
two GitLab self-hosted instances:

```
[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]
url = 'https://git.example.com/'
token = 'glpat-value1'

[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]
url = 'https://git.example.org/'
token = 'glpat-value2'
```

Users can also define group or project-specific keys to apply on an
instance:

```
[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]
url = 'https://git.example.com/'
namespace = 'group-a'
token = 'glpat-value1'

[[gitlab-schedule-badge-instance]]
url = 'https://git.example.com/'
namespace = 'group-b'
token = 'glpat-value2'
```

With a configuration prepared, a user can validate this tool can query
configured GitLab instances using the following command:

```
gitlab-schedule-badge --api-check
```

See the [configuration template][config-template] for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### "Project Not Found"

If GitLab reports that a project cannot be found, this is either two things:

1. The project does not exist. Sanity check that the project path is valid.
2. Access to the project is not permitted with the provided token. Verify
   the token created is done by a user who has access to the specific project,
   or is created for project (or container group) being queried.

### Reverse Proxy with NGINX

If running this tool behind an [NGINX][nginx] reverse proxy, ensure that:

1. Ensure [appropriate `X-Forwarded-*` headers][flask-nginx] are set.
2. Configure both the `server-name` and `reverse-proxy-chain` entries in
   configuration file (`gitlab-schedule-badge.toml`).
