# LangSwarm

LangSwarm is a multi-agent ecosystem that enables collaboration, decision-making, and self-improvement for language models, reinforcement learning (RL), and autonomous systems. Designed to grow with your needs, LangSwarm provides modular tools to tackle complex tasks efficiently and intelligently.

## Key Features
- **Agent Collaboration**: Lay the groundwork for multi-agent communication and coordination.
- **Custom Workflows**: Flexible architecture for distributed problem-solving.
- **Modularity**: Build on LangSwarm-Core and seamlessly integrate upcoming tools like Cortex and Synapse.

## Sub-Packages
LangSwarm is modular by design. Currently, the ecosystem includes:

### **LangSwarm-Core**
The foundation of LangSwarm, providing essential features for:
- Basic agent collaboration.
- Prototyping multi-agent systems.
- Preparing for integration with advanced modules.

#### Coming Soon:
- **LangSwarm-Cortex**: Manage short- and long-term memory, and enable self-reflection for agents.
- **LangSwarm-Synapse**: Implement consensus, aggregation, voting, and branching for distributed decision-making.
- **LangSwarm-Profiler**: Analyze and optimize LLMs, agents, and prompts.
- **LangSwarm-Memory**: Cross-agent centralized memory solutions.
- **LangSwarm-RL**: Reinforcement learning-based orchestration for workflows and agent selection.

## Installation
Install the main LangSwarm package to get started:
```bash
pip install langswarm
```

Or install specific sub-packages as they are released (e.g., Cortex, Synapse):
```bash
pip install langswarm-core
```

## Usage
Here’s a quick example to get started with LangSwarm-Core:
```python
from langswarm.core import Agent

# Define a simple agent
def example_task(data):
    return f"Processed: {data}"

agent = Agent(name="ExampleAgent", task=example_task)

# Run the agent
data = "Hello, LangSwarm!"
result = agent.run(data)
print(result)  # Output: Processed: Hello, LangSwarm!
```

## Roadmap
LangSwarm is an evolving ecosystem. Here’s what’s next:
1. **Cortex** – Memory and self-reflection tools for agent autonomy.
2. **Synapse** – Decision-making and consensus mechanisms.
3. **Profiler** – Tools for analyzing and optimizing agents and prompts.
4. **Memory** – Centralized memory management for cross-agent systems.
5. **RL** – Dynamic orchestration using reinforcement learning.
