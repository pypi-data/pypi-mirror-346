# 🧠 Multi-Source Knowledge Base Builder for LLMs

Python package to transform diverse content into a powerful, structured knowledge base. This tool seamlessly ingests **files** (PDFs, DOCXs, spreadsheets, Markdown, plaintext), **websites** (HTML pages, sitemaps, XML content), and **GitHub repositories**, processes them with state-of-the-art **large language models** (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude), and produces a comprehensive **Markdown knowledge base**. Perfect for creating web-crawlable `/llms.txt` files, powering **RAG applications**, preprocessing content for **vector databases**, or building specialized chatbots. The algorithm uses a logarithmic-depth parallel merge tree with a concurrency-limited semaphore to efficiently process and merge all documents.

## 🌲 Algorithm

The knowledge base builder uses a two-step approach for efficient processing:

1. **Parallel Preprocessing**
   - All documents are preprocessed concurrently into structured KBs
   - Uses a semaphore to limit concurrent LLM requests
   - Each document is converted into a well-formatted Markdown knowledge base
   - Optimized for parallel processing with controlled concurrency

2. **Single Merge**
   - All preprocessed KBs are merged in a single operation
   - Maintains logical structure and organization
   - Reduces total LLM calls compared to recursive approaches
   - More predictable memory usage

This approach provides several advantages:
- Fewer total LLM calls (one per document + one final merge)
- Better parallelization of preprocessing
- More predictable memory usage
- Simpler and more maintainable code
- Faster overall processing time

---

## ⚡ Concurrency Model

The knowledge base builder implements a multi-layer concurrency model to maximize performance while maintaining stability:

### 1. File Processing Concurrency
```python
# Multiple files processed simultaneously
tasks = [process_file_async(file) for file in files]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```
- Enables parallel processing of multiple files
- Each file type (PDF, DOCX, web page, etc.) is processed independently
- Significantly reduces total processing time for multiple files

### 2. CPU-Bound Operations
```python
# CPU-intensive operations run in separate threads
path = await asyncio.to_thread(processor.download, url)
text = await asyncio.to_thread(processor.extract_text, path)
```
- Downloads and text extraction run in separate threads
- Prevents blocking the event loop during I/O operations
- Optimizes CPU utilization across cores

### 3. LLM Processing Concurrency
```python
# Controlled concurrent LLM API calls
async with self._sem:
    result = await self.llm_client.run_async(prompt)
```
- Uses a semaphore to limit concurrent LLM API calls
- Prevents overwhelming the LLM API
- Helps stay within API rate limits
- Default concurrency limit: 8 simultaneous requests

### 4. Final KB Merging
```python
# Concurrent preprocessing followed by single merge
tasks = [preprocess_text_async(text) for text in texts]
preprocessed_kbs = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
final_kb = await merge_all_kbs(preprocessed_kbs)
```
- Preprocesses all documents concurrently
- Merges them into a final knowledge base
- Optimizes both speed and memory usage

### Performance Considerations
- **Resource Management**: CPU-bound operations don't block the event loop
- **Rate Limiting**: LLM API calls are properly throttled
- **Scalability**: System can handle many files without performance degradation
- **Constraints**:
  - LLM concurrency limit (default: 8)
  - System resources (CPU, memory, network)
  - LLM API rate limits

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Memory Usage
- **Document Processing**: Each document is loaded into memory during processing
- **LLM Context Windows**: Different models have different context window limits:
  - Gemini: 1M tokens
- **Merge Operations**: Final merge operation requires all preprocessed KBs in memory
- **Recommendation**: Monitor memory usage when processing large documents or many files

### Processing Time
- **I/O Operations**: Each file requires multiple I/O operations:
  - Downloading/reading the file
  - Text extraction
  - LLM API calls
- **LLM Latency**: Each document requires at least one LLM call:
  - One call per document for preprocessing
  - One final call for merging

### Rate Limits
- **LLM API Limits**: Each provider has different rate limits
- **GitHub API**: 60 requests per hour (unauthenticated)
- **Web Scraping**: Some websites may block rapid requests
