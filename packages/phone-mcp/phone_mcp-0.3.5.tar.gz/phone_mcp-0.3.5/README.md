## ⚡ Quick Start

### 📥 Installation
```bash
# Run directly with uvx (recommended, part of uv, no separate installation needed)
uvx phone-mcp

# Or install with uv
uv pip install phone-mcp

# Or install with pip
pip install phone-mcp
```


### 🔧 Configuration

#### AI Assistant Configuration
Configure in your AI assistant configuration (Cursor, Trae, Claude, etc.):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "phone-mcp": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "phone-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you installed with pip:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "phone-mcp": {
            "command": "/usr/local/bin/python",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "phone_mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Important**: The path `/usr/local/bin/python` in the configuration above is the path to the Python interpreter. You need to modify it according to the actual Python installation location on your system. Here's how to find the Python path on different operating systems:
>
> **Linux/macOS**:
> Run the following command in terminal:
> ```bash
> which python3
> ```
> or
> ```bash
> which python
> ```
>
> **Windows**:
> Run in Command Prompt (CMD):
> ```cmd
> where python
> ```
> Or in PowerShell:
> ```powershell
> (Get-Command python).Path
> ```
>
> Make sure to replace `/usr/local/bin/python` in the configuration with the full path, for example on Windows it might be `C:\Python39\python.exe`

> **Note**: For Cursor, place this configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Usage:
- Use commands directly in Claude conversation, for example:
  ```
  Please call contact hao
  ```

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### App and Activity Launch

The plugin provides multiple ways to launch apps and activities:

1. **By App Name** (Two Methods): 
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Using app command (may not work on all devices)
   phone-cli app camera
   
   # Method 2: Using open_app command (alternative if app command fails)
   phone-cli open_app camera
   ```

2. **By Package Name** (Two Methods): 
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Using app command (may not work on all devices)
   phone-cli app com.android.contacts
   
   # Method 2: Using open_app command (alternative if app command fails)
   phone-cli open_app com.android.contacts
   ```

3. **By Package and Activity** (Most Reliable Method):
   ```bash
   # This method works on all devices
   phone-cli launch com.android.dialer/com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity
   ```

> **Note**: If you encounter issues with the `app` or `open_app` commands, always use the `launch` command with the full component name (package/activity) for the most reliable operation.

### Contact Creation with UI Automation

The plugin provides a way to create contacts through UI interaction:

```bash
# Create a new contact with UI automation
phone-cli create-contact "John Doe" "1234567890"
```

This command will:
1. Open the contacts app
2. Navigate to the contact creation interface
3. Fill in the name and phone number fields
4. Save the contact automatically

### Screen-Based Automation

The unified screen interaction interface allows intelligent agents to easily:

1. **Analyze screens**: Get structured analysis of UI elements and text
2. **Make decisions**: Based on detected UI patterns and available actions
3. **Execute interactions**: Through a consistent parameter system

### UI Monitoring and Automation

The plugin provides powerful UI monitoring capabilities to detect interface changes:

1. **Basic UI monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Monitor any UI changes with custom interval (seconds)
   phone-cli monitor-ui --interval 0.5 --duration 30
   ```

2. **Wait for specific elements to appear**:
   ```bash
   # Wait for text to appear (useful for automated testing)
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for text_appears --text "Login successful"
   
   # Wait for specific ID to appear
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for id_appears --id "confirmation_dialog"
   ```

3. **Monitor elements disappearing**:
   ```bash
   # Wait for text to disappear
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for text_disappears --text "Loading..."
   ```

4. **Get detailed UI change reports**:
   ```bash
   # Get raw JSON data with all UI change information
   phone-cli monitor-ui --raw
   ```

> **Tip**: UI monitoring is especially useful for automation scripts to wait for loading screens to complete or confirm that actions have taken effect in the UI.

# Contact Creation Tool

This tool provides a simple way to create contacts on an Android device using ADB.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and configured
- Android device connected and authorized for ADB

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the script:

```bash
python create_contact.py
```

This will create a contact with default values:
- Account name: "你的账户名"
- Account type: "com.google"

### Advanced Usage

You can provide custom account name and type using a JSON string:

```bash
python create_contact.py '{"account_name": "your_account", "account_type": "com.google"}'
```

### Output

The script outputs a JSON object with:
- `success`: boolean indicating if the operation was successful
- `message`: any output or error message from the command

Example success output:
```json
{"success": true, "message": ""}
```

## Error Handling

- If ADB is not available or device is not connected, the script will return an error
- Invalid JSON input will result in an error message
- Any ADB command errors will be captured and returned in the message field

## Notes

- Make sure your Android device is connected and authorized for ADB use
- The device screen should be unlocked when running the command
- Some devices might require additional permissions to modify contacts

### Apps & Shortcuts
```bash
# Get app shortcuts (with pagination)
phone-cli shortcuts --package "com.example.app"
```
