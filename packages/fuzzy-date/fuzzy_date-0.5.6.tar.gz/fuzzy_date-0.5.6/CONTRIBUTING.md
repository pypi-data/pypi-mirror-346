# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute and help improve **fuzzy-date**.

Easiest way to help is to **[open an issue](https://github.com/aldroid1/fuzzy-date/issues/new)** in order to

- Report invalid, unwanted or missing behaviour
- Generally discuss a topic
- Give feedback

For code changes, you
can [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
and **submit a pull request**. But remember to

- Keep your PR scope minimal
- Make separate PRs for bigger refactoring efforts
- Include appropriate tests
- Use `rustfmt` to format code
