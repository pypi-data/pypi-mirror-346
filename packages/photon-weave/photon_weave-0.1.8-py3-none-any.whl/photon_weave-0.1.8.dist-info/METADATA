Photon Weave is a quantum optics simulator designed for the modeling and analysis of quantum systems. Focusing on individual temporal modes, it offers comprehensive support for simulating quantum states within Fock spaces along with their polarization degrees of freedom.

## Installation

This package can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install photon-weave
```
or it can be installed from this repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tqsd/photon_weave.git
```

### Installation for developing
In case you want to add a feature, you can install the system with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tqsd/photon_weave.git
cd photon_weave
	pip install -e .
```


#### Testing
The tests can simply be run with the `pytest` testing suite. Before running the tests, make sure that the `pytest` is installed in your environment.
```
pip install pytest
# In Photon Weave root directory
pytest
```
