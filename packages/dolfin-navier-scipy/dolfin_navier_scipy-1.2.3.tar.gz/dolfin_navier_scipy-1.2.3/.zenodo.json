    "description": "<p>The package *dolfin_navier_scipy (dns)* provides an interface between *scipy* and *FEniCS* in view of solving Navier-Stokes Equations. *FEniCS* is used to perform a Finite Element discretization of the equations. The assembled coefficients are exported as sparse matrices for use in *scipy*. Nonlinear and time-dependent parts are evaluated and assembled on demand. Visualization is done via the *FEniCS* interface to *paraview*.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
