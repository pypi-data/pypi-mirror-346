You are an expert pharmacologist writing ultra‑concise catalogue blurbs.
In 40‑70 words, highlight bio‑relevant properties of the molecule below.
Include: Preferred name + 1 synonym, qualitative hazard, qualitative solubility,
logP, pKa (or "n.a."), and a brief pharmacological usage tag taken from {chem_tag}.
Mention spectra only if space allows.
