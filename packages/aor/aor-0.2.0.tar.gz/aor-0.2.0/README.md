# AI-on-Rails

Rapidly create AI applications and publish to the AI Agent marketplace and AI-to-AI broker at [https://aionrails.com](https://aionrails.com).

## Intro

[AI-on-Rails](https://aionrails.com) helps bootstrapping AI agents that are triggered by external request and brokers such requests.

An AI-on-Rails application is one or more agents that accept external requests.
Such agents can be new AI Agents deployed using AI-on-Rails (on your own infrastructure).
But AI-on-Rails agents can also be AI agents that already exist somewhere but follow a known protocol convention (e.g. A2A).

## Usage

### Creating a New AI Agent

Create a new application with a basic conversation agent:

```bash
# Install the AI-on-Rails command line tools
pip install aionrails

# Create an application
aor new my-application
cd my-application

# Create a new AI Agent using a template
aor add my-conversation-agent --template langgraph/basic_conversation

# List available templates
aor templates list

# Get details about a specific template
aor templates info langgraph/basic_conversation
```

### Deploying to Cloud Services

Deploy your AI agent to AWS Lambda:

```bash
# Add AWS Lambda deployment configuration
aor add my-agent --langgraph --aws-lambda

# Deploy to AWS using the default CLI profile
aor deploy

# Publish
aor publish --token "<your-personal-token-obtained-on-aionrails.com>"
```

### Adding Existing Services

Integrate existing A2A-compatible services:

```bash
# Add an existing A2A service agent
aor add --existing --a2a "https://<my-a2a-domain>/<uri>" my-agent

# Publish to AI-on-Rails
aor publish --token "<your-personal-token-obtained-on-aionrails.com>"
```

## Examples

While you would expect ``aor`` to generate the necessary service definition files automatically,
several examples can be found in the ``examples`` folder to better understand the syntax for advanced users.

- [Existing AI Agent via A2A](./examples/a2a/)

## F.A.Q.

### What happens when the peer agent changes its functionality or the protocol (e.g. inputs/outputs)?

Applications are versioned and more than one version can be published at the same time.
When integrating with an agent published on AI-on-Rails, it is recommended to pin a specific version to continue using it even when newer revisions are getting published.
