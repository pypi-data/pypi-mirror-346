An open-source alternative to Yahoo Finance's market data APIs with higher reliability.

## Introduction

### Key features:

✅ **Reliable Data**：Sources market data directly from Hugging Face's [yahoo-finance-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bwzheng2010/yahoo-finance-data) dataset, bypassing Yahoo scraping.

✅ **No Rate Limits**：Hugging Face's infrastructure provides guaranteed access without API throttling or quotas.

✅ **High Performance**：[DuckDB's OLAP engine](https://duckdb.org/) + [cache_httpfs](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/cache_httpfs.html) extension delivers sub-second query latency.

✅ **SQL-Compatible**：Python-native interface with full SQL support via DuckDB's optimized execution.

### How it compares to yfinance:
`defeatbeta-api` is not superior to `yfinance` in every aspect, but its free and efficient features make it ideal for users needing bulk historical data analysis.

**Advantages over yfinance:**

**1. No rate limits:** defeat-beta avoids Yahoo Finance’s real-time rate limit by fetching data periodically (typically once a week) and uploading it to `Hugging Face`.

**2. Efficient data format:** It uses the Parquet format, supporting flexible SQL queries via `DuckDB`.

**3. High-performance caching:** Data is stored remotely on `Hugging Face` but leverages `cache_httpfs` for local disk caching, ensuring excellent performance.

**Disadvantages compared to yfinance:**

**Non-real-time data:** defeat-beta updates data on a periodic basis (typically weekly), so it cannot provide real-time data, unlike `yfinance`.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Install `defeatbeta-api` from [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/defeatbeta-api/) using `pip`:

**MacOS / Linux**
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ pip install defeatbeta-api
```

**Windows**
> ⚠️ Windows support requires WSL/Docker Due to dependencies on cache_httpfs (unsupported natively on Windows):

Option 1: WSL (Recommended)
1. Install [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)
2. In WSL terminal:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ pip install defeatbeta-api
```

Option 2: Docker
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
2. Run in Linux container:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker run -it python:latest pip install defeatbeta-api
```

The list of changes can be found in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.rst)

### Usage

Instantiate the `Ticker` class with a company's ticker symbol. For example, to get Tesla, Inc. data:

```python
import defeatbeta_api
from defeatbeta_api.data.ticker import Ticker
ticker = Ticker('TSLA')
```
The following examples demonstrate common API usage patterns (see more examples in [this documentation](doc/Example.md)):
