              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## What is this?

### TLDR: A SetTrie is a container of sets that performs efficient subset and superset queries.

**Settrie** is a Python library implemented in C++ to create, update and query SetTrie objects.

  * Highly efficient C++ implementation.
  * 100% pythonic interface: objects are serializable, use iterators and support native Python sets.

### What problems is Settrie good for?

**Settrie** was born from the need of a better implementation of the algorithm for our recommender system. It has direct application to text
indexing for search in logarithmic time of documents containing a set of words. Think of a collection of documents as a container of
the set of words that each document has. Finding all the documents that contain a set of words is finding the superset of the set of words
in the query. A SetTrie will give you the answer --the list of document names-- in logarithmic time. The data structure is also used in
auto-complete applications.

### What data size can Settrie tackle?

Settrie is a C++ implementation with a Python interface. It is single threaded and can seamlessly operate over really large collections
of sets. Note that the main structure is a tree and a tree node is exactly 20 bytes, a billion nodes is 20 Gb, of course plus some
structures to store identifiers, etc. Note that the tree is compressing the documents by sharing the common parts and documents are already
compressed by considering them a set of words. An of-the-shelf computer can store in RAM a representation of terabytes of documents and
query result in much less than typing speed.

### How does this implementation compare to other Python implementations?

It is about 200 times faster and 20 times more memory efficient that a pure Python implementation.

## Try it without any installation in Google Colab

The API is very easy to use. You can see this benchmark notebook for reference.

  * Benchmark: Comparing two Settrie implementations [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BBVA/mercury-settrie/blob/master/notebooks/settrie_benchmark_colab.ipynb)


## Install

```bash
pip install mercury-settrie
```

## Usage

```python
from settrie import SetTrie

# Create a SetTrie object
stt = SetTrie()

# Insert some sets
stt.insert({2, 3}, 'id1')
stt.insert({2, 3, 4.4}, 'id2')
stt.insert({'Mon', 'Tue'}, 'days')

# Find id by set
print(stt.find({2, 3}))

# Find ids of all supersets
for id in stt.supersets({2, 3}):
    print(id)

# Find ids of all subsets
for id in stt.subsets({2, 3}):
    print(id)

# Nested iteration over the sets and elements
for st in stt:
    print(st.id)
    for e in st.elements:
        print('  ', e)

# Store as a pickle file file
import pickle
with open('my_settrie.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(stt, f)

# Load from a pickle file
with open('my_settrie.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    tt = pickle.load(f)

# Check that they are identical
for t, st in zip(tt, stt):
    assert t.id == st.id
    for et, est in zip(t.elements, st.elements):
        assert et == est

# Remove sets by id
stt.remove('id2')
stt.remove('days')

# After many .remove() calls, the tree has nodes marked as dirty,
# calling .purge() removes them completely and frees RAM.
stt.purge()

```
