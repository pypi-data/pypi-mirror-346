# django-extra-validators

A collection of extra validators for Django, including a strict `HTTPS URL` validator that checks:

- The URL starts with `https://`
- The target is reachable (HTTP 200 OK)
- The URL does **not** redirect (optional, strict mode)
- IBAN validator
- Dutch postal code validator

## Work in Progress

This package is a **work in progress**. I'm actively expanding it with validators commonly needed in real-world Django projects (e.g., URL shorteners, financial forms, address validation).

ðŸ“¬ **Suggestions and contributions are welcome!**  
If you have ideas for useful validators, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.


## Features

- âœ… Enforce secure (`https://`) links
- âœ… Check URL reachability
- âœ… Prevent redirects for link integrity (e.g., in URL shorteners)
- âœ… Designed for use with Django models and forms
- âœ… Fully tested with `pytest` and `unittest.mock`
