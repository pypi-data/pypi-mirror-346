description = "The package **ntrees_tuning** is an **extension to sklearn**. To Random Forests and Gradient Boosting it adds the `ntrees` parameter which gives control over how many trees are used for prediction. The main benefit is that it enables to tune the `ntrees` parameter w.r.t. the OOB-error without having to retrain a new model for each value of `ntrees`."
