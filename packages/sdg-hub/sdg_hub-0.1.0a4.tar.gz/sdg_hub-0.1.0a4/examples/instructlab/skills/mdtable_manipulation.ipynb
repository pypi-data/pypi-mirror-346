    "# Markdown Table Manipulation Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern enterprises rely on structured data to drive decisions across operations, HR, product, and sales. But real-world data is rarely clean. Tables are often inconsistent, incomplete, or split across sources. Analysts and engineers spend countless hours fixing formatting issues, merging data, and applying business logic manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project teaches a language model how to understand, clean, manipulate, and reason over markdown tables—turning messy or fragmented tabular inputs into clean, analysis-ready markdown outputs that can be dropped into dashboards, reports, or downstream systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using InstructLab, by providing examples of real-world table tasks that require reasoning, formatting precision, and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks develop a model’s capabilities in:\n",
    "* Cleaning: Normalize inconsistent entries (e.g., “USA”, “U.S.”, “United States” → “US”)\n",
    "* Filtering: Apply multi-column conditions (e.g., Progress < 60% and Budget < 100k)\n",
    "* Computation: Derive new columns from formulas (e.g., Adjusted Revenue = Revenue × Multiplier)\n",
    "* Joining: Merge data from multiple markdown tables using a shared key\n",
    "* Classification: Infer labels like “Seniority” from unstructured title strings\n",
    "* Standardization: Enforce markdown formatting, column consistency, and data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Examples Include:\n",
    "1.\tApplying Rules Across Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "    Derive new columns by applying conditional logic to existing data. Examples include assigning statuses, flags, or labels based on thresholds, categories, or rule-based formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Cleaning and Normalizing Tabular Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standardize inconsistent entries such as location names, department labels, or text casing to ensure consistency across rows—essential for reliable analysis or joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \tInferring Categorical Labels from Text\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Extract or classify values (e.g., seniority, department type, status) from semi-structured strings using pattern recognition or keyword-based inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \tMerging and Enriching Data Across Tables\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Perform relational joins using keys like ID or Region, and enhance the dataset by combining fields from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Retrieval and Filtering From the Table\n",
    "\n",
    "    Retrieve specific rows or columns based on conditions or patterns, useful for ad-hoc queries or filtering out irrelevant data.\n"

    "## 🏁 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to teach a custom skill to a language model using the InstructLab Skill Data Generator (SDG). Starting from a small set of seed examples, we walked through the full synthetic data generation pipeline — including context creation, question generation, response synthesis, evaluation, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored a real-world use case: **Manipulating Markdown Tables**, and showed how the LAB framework can automate the generation of high-quality, instructional training data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially powerful for procedural or domain-specific tasks where labeled data is scarce but consistent task logic can be modeled. With just a few carefully curated seed examples, you can unlock scalable skill creation and push new capabilities into LLMs with minimal manual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re now ready to use these synthetic examples for Fine-tuning small models! \n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Try changing the parameters of the flow to see how the generated data changes (e.g. change the `num_samples` or try generating with different temperature)\n",
    "* Try adapting this pipeline to your own task, domain, or format — whether it’s triaging support tickets, extracting structured data, or following domain-specific workflows. The skills are yours to create."
