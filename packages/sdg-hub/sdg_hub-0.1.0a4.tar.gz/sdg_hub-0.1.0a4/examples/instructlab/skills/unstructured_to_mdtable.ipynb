    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to teach a custom skill to a language model using the InstructLab Skill Data Generator (SDG). Starting from a small set of seed examples, we walked through the full synthetic data generation pipeline ‚Äî including context creation, question generation, response synthesis, evaluation, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored a real-world use case: **transforming unstructured user feedback into structured markdown tables**, and showed how the LAB framework can automate the generation of high-quality, instructional training data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially powerful for procedural or domain-specific tasks where labeled data is scarce but consistent task logic can be modeled. With just a few carefully curated seed examples, you can unlock scalable skill creation and push new capabilities into LLMs with minimal manual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôre now ready to use these synthetic examples for Fine-tuning small models! \n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Try changing the parameters of the flow to see how the generated data changes (e.g. change the `num_samples` or try generating with different temperature)\n",
    "* Try adapting this pipeline to your own task, domain, or format ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs triaging support tickets, extracting structured data, or following domain-specific workflows. The skills are yours to create."
