# ioos-metrics

A library to compute and compile metrics about the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (U.S. IOOS®). U.S. IOOS® is a vital tool for tracking, predicting, managing, and adapting to changes in our ocean, coastal and Great Lakes environment.

Part of the intent of this repository is to create metrics for the [IOOS by the numbers](https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/ioos-by-the-numbers/).

"IOOS by the Numbers" is was developed as a graphical representation of IOOS  -- a system of includes our partnerships, research and observing components, and data management capabilities.
This figure is an annually updated collection of numbers that show the breadth of the IOOS Program as it is growing and evolving.
These data are obtained from multiple sources. The source for each value is captured in the functions defined at https://github.com/ioos/ioos_metrics/tree/main/ioos_metrics.

## Installation instructions:

### conda
```
conda install ioos-metrics
```

### pip
```
pip install ioos-metrics
```

## Usage

See <https://github.com/ioos/ioos_metrics/tree/main/notebooks>

## Website

url: <https://ioos.github.io/ioos_metrics/>

Leveraged existing resources from <https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox/toolbox_web_templating>.

The webpages are built from the `website/` directory.

| File(s)                               | Description
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
| `*_config.json`                       | configuration for what resources to present on the webpages.
| `create_asset_inventory_page.py`      | script to create https://ioos.github.io/ioos_metrics/asset_inventory.html
| `create_gts_atn_page.py`              | script to create https://ioos.github.io/ioos_metrics/gts_atn.html
| `create_gts_regional_landing_page.py` | script to create https://ioos.github.io/ioos_metrics/gts_regional.html
| `deploy/index.html`                   | html source for landing page https://ioos.github.io/ioos_metrics/index.html
| `deploy/static/main.css`              | css control for website.

## Development

To create the webpages on your local system
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioos/ioos_metrics.git
cd ioos_metrics/website
python create_asset_inventory_page.py
python create_gts_atn_landing_page.py
python create_gts_regional_landing_page.py
```

All the webpages will be saved to `website/deploy`. You can view the local html files with a web browser for testing.

## Deployment

The website is generated using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. The python scripts, referenced above, are ran and the
directory `website/deploy` is then uploaded as an artifact for GitHub Pages to serve as a website.
This process is automatically ran with every push to the `main` branch. See [here](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_metrics/blob/main/.github/workflows/website_create_and_deploy.yml).
