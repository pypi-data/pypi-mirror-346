    geometry of the field of view of the instrument. The table contains
    one row for each image file found on the volume identified by the
    VOLUME_ID keyword above.

    Occasionally, SPICE pointing information is unavailable for the time at
    which an image was exposed. When this situation occurs, no row has been
    added to the file.

    This geometry information has been constructed by uniformly sampling the
    pixels that comprise each image. Pixels have been sampled on an 8x8 grid,
    i.e., every 64th pixel. To accommodate pointing uncertainty, the image
    boundary was expanded on every side by a distance equivalent to 25
    narrow-angle pixels."
