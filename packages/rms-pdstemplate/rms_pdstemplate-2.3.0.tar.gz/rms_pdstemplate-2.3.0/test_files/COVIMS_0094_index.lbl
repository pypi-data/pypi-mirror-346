  DESCRIPTION             = "This version of the Cassini VIMS image index has
been edited by the PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node for compliance with PDS3
standards. Invalid rows have been edited so they obey the specified DATA_TYPE
and can therefore be read more easily by software. For example, where a
numeric column contained '*****', that value has been replaced by '-1.E32'
and, in the label, a numeric value of -1.E32 has been identified as the
NULL_CONSTANT or NOT_APPLICABLE_CONSTANT.

In addition, PDS3 syntax errors have been corrected in this label.

Note that NULL_CONSTANT identifies values that could be known but are not,
whereas NOT_APPLICABLE_CONSTANT refers to values that are undefined. An
example of the former would be a missing value of SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR; an
example of the latter would be a value of LOWER_LEFT_LATITUDE in an image
where the lower left corner does not intercept the target body."
