## INSTALLATION (using PyPI)

Simply use the command `pip install pkaani`. Note that this allows users to run the `calculate_pka` function from within a python script, but the command line usage of pkaani, which involves the use of sander to do energy minimization of the structure before doing `calculate_pka`, will return a `ModuleNotFound` error because `ambertools` is not installed. 

To install ambertools, you can use the command:

```bash
conda install conda-forge::ambertools
```

Note that the use of energy minimization CAN have a significant impact on the pKa results! However, we still wanted to have pKa-ANI available using purely `pip install` and separate from the pre-processing energy minimization - this will be used to integrate pKa-ANI with pdb2pqr.

## INSTALLATION (from source code)

Navigate to this repository for the source code: https://github.com/isayevlab/pKa-ANI/tree/main

Prior to the installation of pKa-ANI, users should make sure they have installed conda.

To install pKa-ANI, navigate to the directory of the source that you've downloaded and;

```bash     
conda env create -f pkaani_env.yaml
```
This will create a conda environment named `pkaani` and install all required packages.
After the environment is created; 
   
```bash    
conda activate pkaani 
python setup.py install
```

### **PREREQUISITES:**

* miniconda/anaconda

If `pkaani_env.yaml` is not used, users should make sure the following packages are installed.
* python=3.8
* numpy
* scipy
* pytorch
* torchani=2.2.0
* scikit-learn=1.0.2
* ase
* joblib
* ambertools
* setuptools=58.2.0

Other libraries the system may require : os,math,sys,io,csv,getopt,shutil,urllib.request,warnings 
		
## **USAGE**

pKa-ANI requires PDB files to have H atoms that are added with default ionization states of residues: ASP, GLU, LYS, TYR, HIE. 

Due to this reason, input PDB file(s) are prepared before the calculation of pKa values (output PDB file __'PDBID_pkaani.pdb'__). 

__We would like to warn users, that our models are trained to predict pKa values for apo-proteins. 
Due to this, any residue that is not an aminoacid is removed from PDB file(s) during the preparation.__


### Example command line usages:

* If PDB file doesnt exist, it is downloaded and prepared for pKa calculations.

```bash
pkaani -i 1BNZ
      
pkaani -i 1BNZ.pdb
```

* Multiple files can be given as inputs

```bash
pkaani -i 1BNZ,1E8L
```

* If a specific directory is wanted:

```bash
pkaani -i path_to_file/1BNZ
      
pkaani -i path_to_file/1BNZ,path_to_file/1E8L
```

### Arguments: 

```bash
-h: Help

-i: Input files. Inputs can be given with or without file extension (.pdb). 
    If PDB file is under a specific directory (or will be downloaded) the path                 
    can also be given as path_to_file/PDBFILE. Multiple PDB files can be given 
    by using "," as separator (i.e. pkaani -i 1BNZ,1E8L).
