# notion-export-prettify

## Export, convert, rest.

This tool enables you to take a standard page export from Notion, and turn it into a branded PDF.

Features:
- Takes as input a zip file generated by Notion's export HTML function
- Manipulates the HTML to:
    - Clean up the content (and remove stuff you want to keep private)
    - Number headings
    - Apply custom CSS with your branding
    - Rejig the table of contents
- Apply branded headers and footers to all pages, with your custom metadata (and page numbers)
- Embed that metadata in the PDF
- Insert a branded cover page

All of those are optional, and will just be done if associated resources are available in the template.

## Templates

Templates?  Yes, you can also have several templates defined, and choose the one to apply when you run the tool.
