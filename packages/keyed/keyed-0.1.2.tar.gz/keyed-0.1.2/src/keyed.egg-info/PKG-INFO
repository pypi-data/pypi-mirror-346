Keyed is a Python library for creating programmatically defined animations. Named after [key frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame), the defining points in an animation sequence, Keyed makes it easy to create sophisticated animations through code.

## Features

- **Reactive Programming Model**: Built using the reactive programming library [signified](https://github.com/dougmercer/signified) to make declaratively defining highly dynamic animations a breeze
- **Vector Graphics**: [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org)-based rendering for crisp, scalable graphics
- **Flexible Shape System**: Define basic lines, shapes, curves, and complex geometries
- **Code Animation**: Animate syntax highled code snippets

## Installation

Keyed requires a couple system level dependencies (e.g., [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/download/) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)).

For detailed installation instructions visit our [Installation Guide](https://dougmercer.github.io/keyed/install)
.

But, once you have the necessary system dependencies installed, installing `keyed` is as simple as,

```console
pip install keyed
```

## Project Status

This project is in beta, so APIs may change.

## Alternatives
While I find `keyed` very fun and useful (particularly for animating syntax highlighted code in my [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@dougmercer)), there are several other excellent and far more mature animation libraries that you should probably use instead.

Before you decide to use `keyed`, be sure to check out:

* [Manim](https://manim.community): Comprehensive mathematical animation system originally created by Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel 3blue1brown, but later adopted and extended by the manim community.
* [py5](https://py5coding.org): A Python wrapper for p5, the Java animation library.
