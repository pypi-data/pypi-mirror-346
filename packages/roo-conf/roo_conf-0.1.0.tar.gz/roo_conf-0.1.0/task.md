# Implementation Task Progress for roo-conf

This file tracks the progress and learnings during the implementation of the roo-conf Python package.

## Tasks:

- Implement the deployment logic in `src/roo_conf/deploy.py`.
- Update `pyproject.toml` to add the `[project.scripts]` entry point.
- Ensure files are correctly read from the package resources.
- Ensure files are written to the target `.roo` directory with the `.md` extension removed.
- Ensure the `{{repo-full-path}}` placeholder is correctly replaced.

## Progress:
- Created `src/roo_conf/deploy.py` with the main deployment logic.
- Implemented getting the current working directory using `pathlib`.
- Implemented creating the target `.roo` directory.
- Implemented accessing package resources using `importlib.resources`.
- Implemented iterating through `.md` files in the prompts directory.
- Implemented reading file content from package resources.
- Implemented replacing the `{{repo-full-path}}` placeholder.
- Implemented writing the modified content to the target directory with the `.md` extension removed.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to add the `[project.scripts]` entry point for `roo-conf`.

## Learnings:

- Confirmed that `importlib.resources.files()` and `read_text()` are suitable for accessing files within the installed package.
- Verified the correct usage of `pathlib.Path.cwd()` for getting the current working directory.
- Handled potential issues with file paths and directory creation.
