# Implementation Task Progress for roo-conf

This file tracks the progress and learnings during the implementation of the roo-conf Python package.

## Tasks:

- Implement the deployment logic in `src/roo_conf/deploy.py`.
- Update `pyproject.toml` to add the `[project.scripts]` entry point.
- Ensure files are correctly read from the package resources.
- Ensure files are written to the target `.roo` directory with the `.md` extension removed.
- Ensure the `{{repo-full-path}}` placeholder is correctly replaced.

## Progress:
- Created `src/roo_conf/deploy.py` with the main deployment logic.
- Implemented getting the current working directory using `pathlib`.
- Implemented creating the target `.roo` directory.
- Implemented accessing package resources using `importlib.resources`.
- Implemented iterating through `.md` files in the prompts directory.
- Implemented reading file content from package resources.
- Implemented replacing the `{{repo-full-path}}` placeholder.
- Implemented writing the modified content to the target directory with the `.md` extension removed.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to add the `[project.scripts]` entry point for `roo-conf`.
- Attempted to build and publish the package using `uv build` and `uv publish`.
- `uv build` was successful, creating `dist/roo_conf-0.1.0.tar.gz` and `dist/roo_conf-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`.
- `uv publish -t $PYPI_API_TOKEN` was successful in publishing the package to PyPi.
- Modified [`src/roo_conf/deploy.py`](src/roo_conf/deploy.py) to use `argparse` for CLI arguments. Added `--file` argument to indicate deployed path and default behavior to list files if no arguments are provided.
- Updated [`README.md`](README.md) to include documentation for the new CLI options (`--file` and listing files).

## Learnings:

- Confirmed that `importlib.resources.files()` and `read_text()` are suitable for accessing files within the installed package.
- Verified the correct usage of `pathlib.Path.cwd()` for getting the current working directory.
- Handled potential issues with file paths and directory creation.
- The `uv publish` command requires an API token for authentication, which can be passed using the `-t` flag with the environment variable.
- Successfully integrated `argparse` into the deployment script to handle different command-line behaviors.
- Updated documentation to reflect new CLI functionality.
