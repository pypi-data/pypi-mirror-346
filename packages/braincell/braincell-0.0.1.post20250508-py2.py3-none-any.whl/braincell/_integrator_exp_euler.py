    r"""
    Perform an exponential Euler step for solving differential equations.

    This function applies the exponential Euler method to solve differential equations
    for a given target module. It can handle both single neurons and populations of neurons.

    Mathematical Description
    -------------------------
    The exponential Euler method is used to solve differential equations of the form:

    $$
    \frac{dy}{dt} = Ay + f(y, t)
    $$

    where $A$ is a linear operator and $f(y, t)$ is a nonlinear function.

    The exponential Euler scheme is given by:

    $$
    y_{n+1} = e^{A\Delta t}y_n + \Delta t\varphi_1(A\Delta t)f(y_n, t_n)
    $$

    where $\varphi_1(z)$ is the first order exponential integrator function defined as:

    $$
    \varphi_1(z) = \frac{e^z - 1}{z}
    $$

    This method is particularly effective for stiff problems where $A$ represents
    the stiff linear part of the system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : DiffEqModule
        The target module containing the differential equations to be solved.
        Must be an instance of HHTypedNeuron.
    t : u.Quantity[u.second]
        The current time point in the simulation.
    *args : 
        Additional arguments to be passed to the underlying implementation.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the target is not an instance of :class:`HHTypedNeuron`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses vectorization (vmap) to handle populations of neurons efficiently.
    The actual computation of the exponential Euler step is performed in the
    `_exp_euler_step_impl` function, which this function wraps and potentially
    vectorizes for population-level computations.
