# fenicsx-growth

`fenicsx-growth` is a Python package for simulating growth in biological tissues using FEniCSx

* Documentation: https://ComputationalPhysiology.github.io/fenicsx-growth
* Source code: https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/fenicsx-growth

## Install

To install `fenicsx_pulse` you need to first [install FEniCSx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx#installation). Next you can install `fenicsx-growth` via pip
```
python3 -m pip install fenicsx-growth
```
We also provide a pre-built docker image with FEniCSx and `fenicsx-growth` installed. You pull this image using the command
```
docker pull ghcr.io/ComputationalPhysiology/fenicsx-growth:v0.1.0
```
