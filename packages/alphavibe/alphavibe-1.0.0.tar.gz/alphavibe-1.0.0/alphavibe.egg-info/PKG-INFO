# alphavibe
alphavibe lets you write Python in the language of TikTok, memes, and group chats. No more `def`, `print`, or `for`. It’s `vibe`, `spitItOut`, and `zoom` now.
# 🍻 alphavibe

> Python, but coded by Gen Alpha. Slay like a sigma 💅

Finally, a python library that passes the vibe check 💯.

---

## ✨ Example

```python
from alphavibe import alphaRun

code = '''
bringIn math

vibe main():
    drip x in zoom range(5):
        spitItOut("Count:", x)
    bounce facts

main()
'''

alphaRun(code)
```

> Output:

```
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
```

## 🚫 Anti-Boomer Filter

We don’t mess with crusty old keywords. If you try to write:

```python
def hello():
    print("hi")
```

You'll get roasted with:

```
🚫 Boomer code at line 1: def found.
💡 Did you mean vibe instead?
```

Boomer-proofed for maximum drip 😤

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install alphavibe
```

---

## 🛠 How to Use

```python
from alphavibe import alphaRun

code = """
vibe hello():
    spitItOut("heyyy")
"""

alphaRun(code)
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

Make your `.py` files full of Gen Alpha code and call `alphaRun(open("myfile.py").read())` to run them like a sigma coder 💪.
