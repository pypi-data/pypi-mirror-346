Datalizer
=========

**Datalizer** is a Python package designed to simplify early-stage data analysis.

Its goal is to help users:

- Load and validate structured datasets
- Detect and resolve common data issues (e.g. missing values, duplicates)
- Prepare numerical data for modeling

Datalizer is ideal for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to focus on insight and modeling â€” not cleanup.
