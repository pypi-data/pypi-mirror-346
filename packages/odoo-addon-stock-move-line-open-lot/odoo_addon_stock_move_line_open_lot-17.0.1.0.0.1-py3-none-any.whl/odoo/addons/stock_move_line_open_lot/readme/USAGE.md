This module modifies the behavior of the lot/serial number button in stock picking operations.

Instead of opening a quick view, the button now opens the "full form view" of the related lot or serial number.

To enable and control this behavior:

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types.
2. Open the desired picking type (Receipts, Delivery Orders,...).
3. In General page /Lot/Serial Numbers section, configure the fields.

Usage Example

- Enable the "Show Lot Button" and/or "Open Lot Form as Popup" on a picking type.
- Create or open a picking that uses tracked products (lot or serial numbers)
- On the picking lines, you will see a icon in lot/serial number.
- Clicking it will open the full form view of the corresponding lot, according to the selected display mode.
