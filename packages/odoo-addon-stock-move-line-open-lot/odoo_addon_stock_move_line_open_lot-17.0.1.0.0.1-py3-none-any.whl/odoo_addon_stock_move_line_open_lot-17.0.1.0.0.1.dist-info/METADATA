The existing button to the right of the lot/serial number, which
currently opens a reduced (quick) view, is removed. It is replaced by a
new button that opens the full form view of the corresponding lot/serial
number when clicked.

This change is controlled by two new boolean fields:

- show_lot_button: If enabled, this field makes the icon "Open Lot Form"
  button visible on the picking form. When this button is clicked, it
  opens the full form view of the corresponding lot/serial number.

- lot_form_as_popup: If enabled, this field ensures the lot form opens
  as a popup/modal instead of a full form view.

Usage
=====

This module modifies the behavior of the lot/serial number button in
stock picking operations.

Instead of opening a quick view, the button now opens the "full form
view" of the related lot or serial number.

To enable and control this behavior:

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types.
2. Open the desired picking type (Receipts, Delivery Orders,...).
3. In General page /Lot/Serial Numbers section, configure the fields.

Usage Example

- Enable the "Show Lot Button" and/or "Open Lot Form as Popup" on a
  picking type.
- Create or open a picking that uses tracked products (lot or serial
  numbers)
- On the picking lines, you will see a icon in lot/serial number.
- Clicking it will open the full form view of the corresponding lot,
  according to the selected display mode.
