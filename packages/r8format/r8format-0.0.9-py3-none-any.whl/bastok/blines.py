    ''' Given a list of "physical" lines `plines` from an expanded BASIC
        file, remove all expanded BASIC comments  and join together plines,
        ignoring leading and trailing spaces, that form a single BASIC
        line.

        "Expanded" BASIC comments start at `commentchar` and continue to
        EOL; any spaces in front of them `commentchar` are also removed.

        A pline is considered to start a BASIC line if it starts with a
        decimal number that is followed at least one non-numeric character
        that is not a comma. This allows for continuation lines for DATA
        statements of numeric values, e.g., `DATA 12,` followed by `34` or
        `34, 56`.
