''' Download and build ROM images.

    This package is designed for use by programs reading command line
    parameters or configuration files specifying how to set up ROM image
    files for emulators or other purposes. It can use existing ROM images
    from files or downloaded from URLs (with optional caching of the
    downloads) and move the data and combine it with other data before
    producing the file ROM file output.

    Generally you will create an initial `RomImage` from an exising file
    containing the ROM data, possibly offset from the original source,
    optionally use `patches()` to apply the relevant patches from a
    sequence of *patchspecs,* and then use `writefile()` or `writefd()` to
    write out the image.

class RomImage:
    ''' A `RomImage` is a sequence of bytes always starting at address
        $0000. (That is the first address in the *ROM,* these are not
        necessarily the addresses to which the ROM is mapped in the
        system's memory, if indeed it is mapped into the CPU's address
        space at all.)

        Each RomImage has an optional *loadspec* for loading the initial
        data, and may be patched with additional *patchspecs* that load
        further data.

        A loadspec is a path or URL, called a *source*, optionally prefixed
        by ``@hhhh:`` where *hhhh* is any number of hexadecimal digits
        specifying an offset in this ROM image at which to load the source.

        A patchspec is a loadspec prefixed by ``name=`` where *name*
        matches the name assigned to this RomImage at instantiation, as
        determined by the `matchname()` function. Patches will overwrite
        the existing RomImage data only from the patchspec's start address
        to the length of the retrieved data.

            There are two instances that can cause collisions that we
            (currently) don't deal with:

            1. We remove any leading and trailing slashes to avoid "blank"
               path components, but this also strips information about
               whether it was a relative or absolute path, which can create
               collisions.

            2. We entirely ignore any URL parameters, and so collide if we
               are downloading something such as ``/rom/foo?ver=1.1``
               versus ``ver=1.2``.

            Both of these problems We ignore for the moment because they
            are difficult to handle and relatively unlikely and hard to
            handle.
