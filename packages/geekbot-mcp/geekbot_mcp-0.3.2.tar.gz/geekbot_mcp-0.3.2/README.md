**Unlock your Geekbot data within your LLM applications üöÄ**

Geekbot MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as a bridge, connecting LLM client applications (like Claude) directly to your Geekbot workspace. This allows you to interact with your standups, reports, and team members seamlessly within your conversations using natural language.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Access Standup Information**: List all standups in your Geekbot workspace. üìä
- **Retrieve Standup Reports**: Fetch reports with filters for specific standups, users, or date ranges. üìÑ
- **View Team Members**: Get a list of members you collaborate with in Geekbot. üë•

## Installation üíª

Requires Python 3.10+ and `uv`.

1. **Install uv (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    (See [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options.)

2. **Install Geekbot MCP:**

    ```bash
    uv tool install geekbot-mcp
    ```

## Upgrading ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

To update to the latest version:

```bash
  uv tool install --upgrade geekbot-mcp
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Connect Geekbot MCP to your LLM (e.g., Claude Desktop):

1. **Get your Geekbot API Key:** Find it in your [Geekbot API/Webhooks settings](https://geekbot.com/dashboard/api-webhooks) üîë.

2. **Find your `uv` executable path:**

    ```bash
      which uv
    ```

3. **Configure your LLM client application:** Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` (or equivalent configuration file for other MCP clients) to add Geekbot MCP server
    ```json
    {
      "globalShortcut": "",
      "mcpServers": {
        // Add or update this section
        "geekbot-mcp": {

          "command": "<path-returned-by-which-uv>", // Replace with your actual uv path
          "args": [
            "tool",
            "run",
            "geekbot-mcp"
          ],
          // Environment variables needed by the server
          "env": {
            "GB_API_KEY": "<your-geekbot-api-key>" // Replace with your actual API key
          }
        }
        // ... other MCP servers if any
      }
      // ... other configurations
    }
    ```

    For use with Claude Desktop, install the client and follow the quickstart guide:
    *(Refer to the [MCP Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more details on client configuration.)*
