            image_loader (OpenSlide): OpenSlide Image. Needed for OS compatibility and for retrieving metadata.
            tile_size (int, optional): the width and height of a single tile.  For best viewer

                          of two.. Defaults to 254.
            overlap (int, optional): the number of extra pixels to add to each interior edge
                          of a tile. Defaults to 1.
            limit_bounds (bool, optional): True to render only the non-empty slide region. Defaults to False.
