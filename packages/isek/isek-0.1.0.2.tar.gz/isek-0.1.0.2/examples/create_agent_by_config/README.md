You can find out the details of the configuration file through [default_config.yaml](../../isek/default_config.yaml)

Dobby: [dobby_config.yaml](dobby/dobby_config.yaml) 

Sylana: [sylana_config.yaml](sylana/sylana_config.yaml)

``` yaml
llm: "openai"
llm.openai:
  model_name: your_model_name
  base_url: your_base_rul
