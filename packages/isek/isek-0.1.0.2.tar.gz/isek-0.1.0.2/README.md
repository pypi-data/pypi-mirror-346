# Isek: Distributed Cooperative-Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework

**Isek** is a lightweight, modular, and distributed multi-agent framework built for the next generation of **cooperative autonomous systems**. Agents in Isek aren’t just isolated functions — they form a **decentralized society**, discovering peers, sharing context, and collaboratively solving complex tasks across nodes.

With built-in LLM integration and an intuitive CLI, Isek is ideal for researchers, developers, and builders designing intelligent, collaborative agents in distributed environments.

> 🧪 **Isek is under active development** — your feedback, experiments, and contributions are highly welcome.

## Key Features

- **Cooperative Autonomy:**
  Agents autonomously discover suitable peers in the network, communicate, and collaborate to complete tasks in a decentralized fashion.

- **Distributed Agent Orchestration:**
  Spin up and manage intelligent agents across multiple nodes with flexible task assignment and coordination..

- **LLM Integration:**
  Built-in support for integrating Large Language Models such as OpenAI, enabling advanced NLP functionalities.

- **Modular Design:**
  Highly modular architecture ensures ease of maintenance, scalability, and flexibility for customization.

- **Lightweight and User-Friendly:**
  Designed for easy adoption, providing a streamlined user experience without complex setup or heavy dependencies.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install isek
```

**Python 3.8+** is required.

# Known Issue
  for 3.9.6 on MAC ifsphinx-quickstart you see faiss-cpu error. try:
  brew install swig

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Your API Environment

Create a `.env` file at the root:

```env
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### 2. Quickly Build Distributed Agents

``` python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from isek.agent.distributed_agent import DistributedAgent

load_dotenv()
agent = DistributedAgent()
agent.build(daemon=True)
agent.run_cli()
```
This launches an agent with distributed interaction capabilities, and you can talk to it through the console.

## 🧪 CLI Usage

Clean up configs and temp files:

```bash
 isek clean
```

Show all available commands:

```bash
 isek --help
```
