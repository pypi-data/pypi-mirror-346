## Overview

FlowIO is a Python library for reading and writing Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS)
files, with minimal dependencies and is compatible with Python 3.9+. It is intended 
as a lightweight library, suitable for parsing FCS data sets (e.g. as a web server 
backend, for simple metadata extraction, etc.). For higher level cytometry analysis, 
please see the related [FlowKit](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit) library which 
offers a much wider set of analysis options such as compensation, transformation, 
and gating support (including support for importing FlowJo 10 workspaces).

If you have any questions about FlowIO, find any bugs, or feel something is missing 
from the documentation [please submit an issue to the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/whitews/FlowIO/issues/new/).
