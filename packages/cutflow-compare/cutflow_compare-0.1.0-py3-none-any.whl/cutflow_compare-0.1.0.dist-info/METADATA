# cutflow_compare

## Overview
`cutflow_compare` is a Python package designed to compare cutflow histograms from ROOT files. It provides a straightforward command-line interface for users to analyze and visualize differences in cutflow data across different regions.

## Features
- Compare cutflow histograms from multiple ROOT files.
- Generate a CSV report of the comparison results.
- Easy to use with command-line arguments for file input and region selection.

## Installation
You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install cutflow_compare
```

## Usage
To compare cutflow histograms, run the following command:

```
python cutflow_compare.py --files histoOut-compared.root histoOut-reference.root -r region1 region2 region3
```

### Arguments
- `--files`: List of input ROOT files to compare.
- `--regions`: List of regions to compare within the cutflow histograms.

## Example
```bash
python cutflow_compare.py --files histoOut-compared.root histoOut-reference.root -r region1 region2
```

This command will compare the specified regions in the two provided ROOT files and output the results to `cutflow_comparison_result.csv`.
