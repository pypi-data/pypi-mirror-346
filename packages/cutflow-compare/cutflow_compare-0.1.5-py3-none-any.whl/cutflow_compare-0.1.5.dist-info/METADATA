# cutflow_compare

## Overview
`cutflow_compare` is a Python package designed to compare cutflow histograms from ROOT files. It provides a straightforward command-line interface for users to analyze and visualize differences in cutflow data across different regions.

## Features
- Compare cutflow histograms from multiple ROOT files.
- Generate a CSV report of the comparison results.
- Easy to use with command-line arguments for file input and region selection.

## Installation
You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install cutflow_compare
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the command-line tool directly:

```
cutflow_compare --files histoOut-compared.root histoOut-reference.root -r region1 region2 region3
```

Or, if running from source:

```
python cutflow_compare.py --files histoOut-compared.root histoOut-reference.root -r region1 region2 region3
```

### Note: 
Make sure the same regions are present in both files with the same name.

### Arguments
- `--files`: List of input ROOT files to compare. Required.
- `--regions`: List of regions to compare within the cutflow histograms. Required.
- `--separate-selections`: Optional flag to keep selections separate instead of merging them.
- `--relative-error`: Optional flag to include relative error calculations in the output.

### Output
The tool generates a CSV file named `cutflow_comparison_result.csv` containing the comparison results. If the `--relative-error` flag is used, the CSV will also include relative error calculations for each region.

## Example
```bash
cutflow_compare --files histoOut-compared.root histoOut-reference.root -r region1 region2 region3 --relative-error
```

This command compares the specified regions (`region1`, `region2`, `region3`) in the two provided ROOT files (`histoOut-compared.root` and `histoOut-reference.root`). It outputs the results to `cutflow_comparison_result.csv`, including relative error calculations.

This command will compare the specified regions in the two provided ROOT files and output the results to `cutflow_comparison_result.csv`.
## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (must be installed separately, e.g., via conda: `conda install -c conda-forge root`)
- pandas (install via pip: `pip install pandas`)
- uncertainties (install via pip: `pip install uncertainties`)

Make sure all dependencies are installed before running the tool.
