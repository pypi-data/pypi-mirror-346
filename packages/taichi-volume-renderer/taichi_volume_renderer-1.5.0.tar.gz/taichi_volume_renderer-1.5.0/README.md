# taichi-volume-renderer
**taichi-volume-renderer** is a python package for real-time **GPU** volume rendering based on [taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi).

You don't need to understand Taichi to use this package. For the simplest application — visualizing a 3D scalar NumPy array `a` as volume smoke — you can do it with just one line of code:

```python
import taichi_volume_renderer

taichi_volume_renderer.plot_volume(a)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install taichi-volume-renderer
```

## Usage

### Interactive Static Scenes

The simplest example would be rendering a static scene, with smoke density, color, and lighting all specified by a few NumPy arrays. See `examples/example.py`.

Volume rendering provides an impressive capability to display faintly visible objects with indistinct boundaries. The following example visualizes a Lorenz attractor. See `examples/strange_attractor.py`.

### High-Performance Real-Time Visualization

The **taichi-volume-renderer** is built to work flawlessly with Taichi, enabling dynamic scene visualization. The following example solves a partial differential equation (PDE), specifically the Gray-Scott model, while visualizing the system's evolution in real-time. The script also saves an `.gif` animation. See `examples/pde.py`.

I also made a video demonstrating the dazzlingly complex behavior of this system through parameter changes. Check it out at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g7LVzVEQW/

### Canvas

You can use **taichi_volume_renderer.canvas** to draw in 3D space. This module offers rich and user-friendly drawing functionalities.

Note that these drawing methods fundamentally differ from traditional 3D mesh creation in conventional modeling software—here, objects are rendered as bitmaps in a 3D voxel array. This relationship is analogous to how SVG vector graphics differ from BMP raster images in 2D. Such an approach unlocks possibilities for entirely new 3D design workflows.

See `examples/canvas.py`.

### VDB

You can also render VDB data with taichi-volume-renderer. See `examples/openvdb.py`. We can apply general lighting, or illuminate the volume from within like cloud-to-cloud lightning.

### Refraction

Refractive volume rendering allows visualizing objects with refractive behavior without constructing a mesh. See `examples/refraction.py`, where a glass ball is rendered.

The following example uses the Position Based Fluids (PBF) algorithm (Macklin, M. and Müller, M., 2013) to simulate fluids in real-time and renders them as a transparent material. The code is adapted from Ye Kuang's Taichi demo, [pbf2d.py](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/master/python/taichi/examples/simulation/pbf2d.py). Since no meshing is required, the entire pipeline can be executed on the GPU. See `examples/pbf3d.py`.

Continuous distribution of refractive indices is supported, allowing simulating phenomena such as heat haze or mirages. See `examples/mirage.py`.

## TODO

1. Adjust the camera distance with scroll wheel
2. Default lights
3. Background images
4. Ray intersection with the scene
5. Supports volumetric data with non-cuboid shapes
6. Draw disks and lines
7. Reflection
8. Secondary scattering
9. Sparse grid
