# Terrakio API Client

A Python client for Terrakio's Web Coverage Service (WCS) API.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
$ pip install terrakio-api==0.1.8
```

## Configuration

1. Obtain a Personal Access Token:
   - Open the following link for the terrakio_doc - https://test-341.gitbook.io/terrakio/terrak.io/authentication
   - Sign up for the terrakio platform illustrated in the doc
   - Log in for the terrakio platform illustrated in the doc
   - Generate the key for the platform
   - The above generate command should have generated a config file (`$HOME/.tkio_config.json`, if you are on a linux system, the $HOME indicates the root), in which it stores the EMAIL and the TERRAKIO_API_KEY
   - The personal access key is being stored here

## Important Notes
- Always review and agree to the Terms and Conditions for each dataset you intend to download.

# Test

Perform a small test retrieve of precipitation_m15 data:

```
import terrakio_api
from terrakio_api import Client
from shapely.geometry import Point
# 1. Initialize the client
client = Client()  # This will read from $HOME/.tkio_config.json, which will get the your api key, the default url for the server is https://api.terrak.io
# 2. Create a geographic feature (point)
point = Point(149.057, -35.1548)
geojson ={
     "type": "Feature",
          "geometry": {
               "type": "Point",
               "coordinates": [point.x, point.y]
          },
          "properties": {
               "name": "Location in Canberra region",
               "description": "Coordinates: 149.057, -35.1548"
          }
}
# 3. Make a WCS request
dataset = client.wcs(
     expr="prec=MSWX.precipitation@(year=2024, month=1)\nprec",
     feature=geojson,
     output="netcdf"  # Specify output format (csv, netcdf, etc.)
     )
# 4. Work with the resulting xarray dataset
print(dataset)

# If you want to change the key, you could either pass the new key to the Client function like client = Client( key = NEW_KEY ) or just go into the $HOME/.tkio_config.json file and change it manually.
# If you want to change the url, you could just pass the new url to the Client function like client = Client( url = NEW_URL )
```
