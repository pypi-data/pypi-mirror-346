# 🔁 Similar String Grouper

A minimal Python tool to group similar strings based on circular rotations.
It identifies words that are rotations of each other and groups them into distinct sets.

## ✅ What it does

Given a list of strings, it groups words that are circularly similar.

For example, "abcd" and "cdab" are grouped together because one can be rotated into the other.

### Input

```python
["abcd", "cdab", "dabc", "bcda", "efgh", "ghfe"]
```

### Output

```python
{
  "abcd": ["abcd", "cdab", "dabc", "bcda"],
  "efgh": ["efgh"],
  "ghfe": ["ghfe"]
}
```

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install rotate-group-words==0.3.0
```

## 📦 Usage

### In Code:

```python
from rotate-group-words import rotate_group_words

input = ["abcd", "cdab", "dabc", "bcda", "efgh", "ghfe"]
output = rotate_group_words(input)
print(output)

```

### As standalone cli application

```bash
rgw -h
rgw -w abcd,cdab,dabc,bcda,efgh,ghfe
```

## ⚙️ How it works

- Similarity Rule: Two words are similar if a rotation of one equals the other.

- Efficiency: The similarity check (is_similar) is optimized from O(n) to O(1).

- Grouping: Uses a visited set to avoid duplicate processing.

- Non-destructive: Does not mutate the input.
