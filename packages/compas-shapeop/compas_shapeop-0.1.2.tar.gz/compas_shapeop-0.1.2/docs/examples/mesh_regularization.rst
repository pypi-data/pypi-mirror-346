Mesh Regularization
********************************************************************************

This example demonstrates how to use COMPAS ShapeOp to regularize a mesh by applying regularization constraints to make polygon faces more regular and planarization constraints to make faces planar. The example shows the integration between COMPAS meshes, the ShapeOp solver, and the COMPAS viewer for interactive visualization.
