Not ready to upgrade yet? No problem! Run `git checkout 0.10.1` to continue using the previous version.

## (Meshtastic <=> Matrix Relay)

A powerful and easy-to-use relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, allowing seamless communication across platforms. This opens the door for bridging Meshtastic devices to [many other platforms](https://matrix.org/bridges/).

---

## Getting Started

MMRelay runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Install using pipx for isolated installation (recommended)
pipx install mmrelay

# Pip will also work if you prefer
pip install mmrelay
```

### Resources

- **New Users**: See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for setup and configuration
- **Existing Users**: See [UPGRADE_TO_V1.md](UPGRADE_TO_V1.md) for migration guidance
- **Configuration**: Review [sample_config.yaml](src/mmrelay/tools/sample_config.yaml) for examples

## Features

- Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic devices and Matrix chat rooms, capable of supporting multiple meshnets
- Supports serial, network, and **_BLE (now too!)_** connections for Meshtastic devices
- Custom fields are embedded in Matrix messages for relaying messages between multiple meshnets
- Truncates long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size
- SQLite database to store node information for improved functionality
- Customizable logging level for easy debugging
- Configurable through a simple YAML file
- Supports mapping multiple rooms and channels 1:1
- Relays messages to/from an MQTT broker, if configured in the Meshtastic firmware
- ✨️ _Cross-platform reactions support_ ✨️ **NEW!!**

_We would love to support [Matrix E2EE rooms](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/issues/33), but this is currently not implemented._

### Community & Custom Plugins

It is possible to create custom plugins and share them with the community. Check [example_plugins/README.md](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/tree/main/example_plugins) and the [Community Plugins Development Guide](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-Development-Guide).

✨️ Visit the [Community Plugins List](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-List)!

#### Install a Community Plugin

Add the repository under the `community-plugins` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
community-plugins:
  example-plugin:
    active: true
    repository: https://github.com/jeremiah-k/mmr-plugin-template.git
    tag: main
```

### Plugin System

MMRelay features a powerful plugin system with standardized locations:

- **Core Plugins**: Pre-installed with the package
- **Custom Plugins**: Your own plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/custom/`
- **Community Plugins**: Third-party plugins in `~/.mmrelay/plugins/community/`

Plugins make it easy to extend functionality without modifying the core code.
