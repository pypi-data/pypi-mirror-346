    "- [NumPyro-ext](https://github.com/dfm/numpyro-ext) : a package that extends NumPyro with a set of helper functions, custom distributions and other utilities.\n",
    "- [corner](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : a package to visualize multidimensional samples using a scatterplot matrix.\n",
    "- [Arviz](https://python.arviz.org/en/stable/) : a package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models\n",

    "In addition, the [Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/) may be required to download real datasets from the Kepler and TESS missions.\n",
