    "# Automatic differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The major selling point of `jaxoplanet` compared to other similar libraries is that it builds on top of `JAX`, which extends numerical computing tools like `numpy` and `scipy` to support automatic [automatic differentiation (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) and hardware acceleration.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we present an introduction to the AD capabilities of `JAX` and `jaxoplanet`, but we won't go too deep into the technical weeds of how automatic differentiation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into too many details about AD and most users of `jaxoplanet` shouldn't need to interact with these features directly very often, but this should at least give you a little taste of the kinds of things AD can do for you and demonstrate how this translates into efficient inference with probabilistic models.\n",
    "The main thing that I want to emphasize here is that AD is not the same as *symbolic differentiation* (it's not going to provide you with a mathematical expression for your gradients), but it's also not the same as numerical methods like [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).\n",
    "Using AD to evaluate the gradients of your model will generally be faster, more efficient, and more numerically stable than alternatives, but there are always exceptions to any rule.\n",
    "There are times when providing your AD framework with a custom implementation and/or differentation rule for a particular function is beneficial in terms of cost and stability.\n",
    "`jaxoplanet` is designed to provide these custom implementations only where it is useful (e.g. solving Kepler's equation or evaluating limb-darkened light curves) and then rely on the existing AD toolkit elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic differentiation in JAX\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core features of `JAX` is its support for automatic differentiation (AD; that's what the \"A\" in `JAX` stands for).\n",
    "To differentiate a Python function using `JAX`, we start by writing the function using `JAX`'s `numpy` interface.\n",
    "In this case, let's use a made up function that isn't meant to be particularly meaningful:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\exp\\left[\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\,\\pi\\,x}{3}\\right)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then calculate the derivative using AD.\n",
    "For comparison, the symbolic derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{2\\,\\pi}{3}\\,\\exp\\left[\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\,\\pi\\,x}{3}\\right)\\right]\\,\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\,\\pi\\,x}{3}\\right)\n",

    "This example is pretty artificial, but I think that you can imagine how something like this would start to come in handy when your models get more complicated.\n",
