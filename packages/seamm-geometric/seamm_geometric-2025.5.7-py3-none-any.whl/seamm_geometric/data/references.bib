This is an initial library of BibTex references for the energy_scan_step plug-in for SEAMM,
generated automatically by the cookiecutter. You may wish to edit the first entry to correct some
of the information.

Add other references to the end of the file and add code in the plug-in to cite the references as
appropriate. This is done with code like this:

        self.references.cite(
            raw=self._bibliography['doi:10.1002/jcc.21224'],
            alias='packmol',
            module='packmol_step',
            level=1,
            note='The principle PACKMOL citation.'
        )

which is typically in the run() method of the plug-in.

The base node class in SEAMM automatically reads this list of references into a dictionary in
self._bibliography with the key being the key of the BibTex entry -- usually the name on the
first line of the entry after the 'article' or 'misc' (for software) keyword.

See the documentation for the Reference Handler for the other arguments to cite().

    abstract = "{ The effective description of molecular geometry is important for theoretical studies of intermolecular interactions. Here we introduce a new translation-rotation-internal coordinate (TRIC) system which explicitly includes the collective translations and rotations of molecules, or parts of molecules such as monomers or ligands, as degrees of freedom. The translations are described as the centroid position and the orientations are represented with the exponential map parameterization of quaternions. When TRIC is incorporated into geometry optimization calculations, the performance is consistently superior to existing coordinate systems for a diverse set of systems including water clusters, organic semiconductor donor-acceptor complexes, and small proteins, all of which are characterized by nontrivial intermolecular interactions. The method also introduces a new way to scan the molecular orientations while allowing orthogonal degrees of freedom to relax. Our findings indicate that an explicit description of molecular translation and rotation is a natural way to traverse the many-dimensional potential energy surface. }",
