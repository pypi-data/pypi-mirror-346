# SEGA_LEARN

SEGA_LEARN is a custom package implementating machine learning algorithms built from the Python standard library as well as NumPy and SciPy.
It includes scratch implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including clustering, linear models, neural networks, and trees.
The project also includes scripts for testing, documentation generation, and other tasks.

The project is organized into several directories, each with its own purpose.
The `SEGA_LEARN/` directory contains the main library code, while the `tests/` directory contains unit and performance tests.
The `examples/` directory contains example usages of the library, and the `docs/` directory contains the generated documentation.
The `scripts/` directory contains PowerShell scripts to help with various tasks.

This project was created with the goal of learning about the internals of machine learning algorithms and how they work under the hood.
As well as for exploration of Python packages for speed and performance.
It is not intended for production use and should be used for educational purposes only (See performance tests for scalability).
Many of the algorithms are not optimized for performance and may not be suitable for large datasets.

This project was heavily inspired by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Tests
An extensive suite of unit tests is included in the `tests/` directory.
These tests ensure the functionality and reliability of each module in the library, as well as the overall package.
The tests are organized into subdirectories based on the module they test. Each module is tested for imports, functionality, and example usage.

### Test Logic
- **Imports**: Tests to ensure that all modules can be imported without errors.
- **Functionality**: Tests to ensure that the functions and classes in each module work as expected.
