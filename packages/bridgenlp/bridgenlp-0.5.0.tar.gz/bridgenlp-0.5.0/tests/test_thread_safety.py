"""
Tests for thread safety in the Pipeline class.

These tests verify that the Pipeline class correctly handles concurrent access
from multiple threads, with a focus on:
1. Thread-safe input processing methods (from_text, from_tokens, etc.)
2. Thread-safe cache operations
3. Thread-safe condition checking
4. Thread-safe result combination
