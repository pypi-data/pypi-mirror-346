"""Objects module for the FDTDX electromagnetic simulation framework.

This module provides classes and utilities for defining and manipulating objects
within FDTD simulations. It includes support for:

- Material objects with wavelength-dependent properties
- Geometric constraints and positioning
- Boundary conditions and PML layers
- Sources and detectors
- Object containers for managing multiple simulation elements

The objects module enables intuitive positioning and sizing of elements in absolute
or relative coordinates within the simulation scene, with automatic constraint resolution.
