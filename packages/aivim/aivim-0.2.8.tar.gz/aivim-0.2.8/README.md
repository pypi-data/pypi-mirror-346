## Usage

### Basic Editing
- Press `i` to enter insert mode, `ESC` to return to normal mode
- Use `:w` to save, `:q` to quit, `:wq` to save and quit
- Navigation works with arrow keys (primary) or `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` keys (alternative)
- Jump to specific lines with `:1`, `:14`, `:$`, or use `G`/`Shift+G` (last line)
- Search for text with `/pattern` (forward) or `?pattern` (backward)
- Use `n` to find next match, `N` to find previous match
- Replace text with `:%s/old/new/g` syntax

### NLP Mode
- Enter NLP mode with command `:nlp` or by pressing `n` then `l` in normal mode
- In insert mode, use `Ctrl+X` then `Ctrl+N` to switch to NLP mode
- Write code using natural language comments that will be automatically translated to code
- Mark NLP sections in your code with special comments:
  ```
  # NLP-BEGIN
  # Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number
  # NLP-END
  ```
  Or with the new inline format:
  ```
  #nlp Calculate factorial of a number recursively
  ```
- The editor will automatically detect comment blocks and translate them to code
- Changes are applied after you stop typing (debounce delay)
- **Enhanced keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `Enter` creates a new line just like in INSERT mode
  - `Shift+Enter` processes only the current file's NLP sections
  - `Ctrl+Enter` processes the entire script with all tabs as context
- Use `:nlpmark <start> <end>` to manually mark a section for translation
- Force immediate translation with `:nlptranslate` command (improved with visual feedback)
- All open files in tabs are considered context for better code generation

### AI Features
1. Navigate to the code you want to work with
2. In normal mode, type `:explain 10 20` to explain lines 10-20
3. Use `:improve 10 20` to get improvement suggestions:
   - A new tab opens showing a colorized diff view of proposed changes
   - Review the modifications in the diff view
   - To apply the changes, switch back to the original tab and confirm
   - A backup of the original file is automatically created with a timestamp
4. Generate code with `:generate 5 "Create a function that calculates factorial"` - It will be inserted at the line 5 of your current file.
5. Analyze code with `:analyze 10 20` to identify complexity issues and potential bugs
6. Ask questions with `:ai query How does this algorithm work?`
7. Switch between AI providers:
   - Use `:model` to open an interactive model selector with arrow key navigation
   - Use `:model openai` to directly switch to OpenAI
   - Use `:model claude` to directly switch to Anthropic Claude
   - Use `:model local` to directly switch to local LLM
   - Legacy: `:set model=openai`, `:set model=claude`, or `:set model=local`

## Installation from GitHub/Source

To install AIVim:

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/danimoya/aivim-editor.git
cd AIVim-Editor
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run AIVim
python -m aivim.run_editor <file>
```

To make an alias for current session or install in .bash_profile, try something like:
```bash
alias aivim="python -m aivim.run_editor"
```

#### System-wide Installation

To make AIVim available as a system-wide command (`aivim`), follow these steps:

```bash
# For temporary use in current session
alias aivim='python -m aivim.run_editor'

# For permanent installation, add to your shell configuration
echo 'alias aivim="python -m aivim.run_editor"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Or for Zsh
echo 'alias aivim="python -m aivim.run_editor"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Apply changes without restarting the terminal
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

For a more robust system-wide installation, create a symbolic link:

```bash
# Create a symbolic link in a directory that's in your PATH
sudo ln -s "$(which python) $(pwd)/run_editor.py" /usr/local/bin/aivim
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aivim

# Now you can run AIVim from anywhere
aivim myfile.py
```

### VENV Installation

To isolate "aivim" from system Python libraries, do the following:

```bash
python -m venv aivim
source aivim/bin/activate
pip install aivim
pip install anthropic llama-cpp-python
```

### Configuration File

Instead of setting environment variables, you can create a configuration file for storing API keys. AIVim will automatically check the following locations for a config file:

1. `~/.aivim/config`
2. `~/.config/aivim/config`
3. `~/.aivimrc`
4. `./aivim.config` (in the current directory)

Create a configuration file with the following format:

```ini
# AIVim Configuration File

[General]
# Choose your default AI model provider: openai, claude, or local
default_model = openai

[OpenAI]
# Your OpenAI API key (get it from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
api_key = your_openai_api_key_here

[Anthropic]
# Your Anthropic Claude API key (get it from https://console.anthropic.com/)
api_key = your_anthropic_api_key_here

[LocalLLM]
# Path to your local model file (generally a .gguf file)
model_path = /path/to/your/local/model.gguf
```

To create this configuration file:

```bash
# Create a config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/aivim

# Create and edit the configuration file
nano ~/.config/aivim/config

# Set proper permissions to protect your API keys
chmod 600 ~/.config/aivim/config
```

When AIVim starts, it will display information about the config file it loaded and the AI model being used in the status bar.

## Setting Up Local LLM Support

AIVim supports using local LLM models via llama-cpp-python:

```bash
# Install the local LLM package
pip install llama-cpp-python

# Download a small model using the provided script
python download_local_model.py --model tinyllama

# Or list available models
python download_local_model.py --list

# Once downloaded, you can use it by setting the model:
# Inside AIVim: :model local (or :model to show the selector)
```

The download_local_model.py script supports several small models suitable for local execution:

| Model | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| tinyllama | ~1GB | Small but capable model for code assistance |
| phi2 | ~1.7GB | Microsoft compact yet powerful model |
| stablelm | ~1.5GB | Stability AI efficient language model |

## Web Interface

AIVim also includes a web interface for easy access:

```bash
# Start the web server
python main.py

# Access AIVim in your browser at:
# http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

The web interface provides access to all the AI-powered features through a more traditional web IDE experience. It communicates with the same AI services backend as the terminal-based editor.

## Embedding AIVim

AIVim can be embedded into other Python applications:

```python
from aivim import embed_editor

# Open a file in the embedded editor
embed_editor("path/to/file.py")

# Or create a new file
embed_editor()
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (set as OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable)
- Optional: Anthropic API key (set as ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable)
- Optional: Local LLM model (set model path as LLAMA_MODEL_PATH environment variable)
- curses library (included with Python on most systems)
