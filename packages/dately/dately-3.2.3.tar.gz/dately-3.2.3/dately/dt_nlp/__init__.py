# doydl's Temporal Parsing & Normalization Engine — dately
#
# The `dately` module is a deterministic engine for parsing, resolving, and normalizing
# temporal expressions across both natural and symbolic language contexts — built for NLP
# workflows, cross-platform date handling, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.
#
# Designed with formal grammatical rigor, `dately` interprets phrases like “first five days of next month,” 
# “Q3 of last year,” and “April 3” — handling cardinal/ordinal resolution, anchored structures, and 
# ambiguous or implicit references with linguistic sensitivity.
#
# The engine combines structured tokenization, symbolic transformation, and rule-based semantic 
# composition to support precision across tasks such as entity recognition, information extraction, 
# and temporal normalization in noisy or informal text.
#
# It guarantees invertibility, transparency, and cross-platform consistency, resolving platform-specific 
# formatting differences (e.g. Windows vs. Unix) while maintaining NLP-grade flexibility for English-language 
# temporal constructions.
#
# Whether embedded in intelligent agents, ETL pipelines, or legal/medical NLP systems, `dately` brings 
# clarity and structure to temporal meaning — bridging symbolic logic with real-world language.
