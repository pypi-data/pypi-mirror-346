package(USEPKG GriffAnaUtils)

######################################################################

Package providing examples for analysis of Griff files.

4 of the examples are used to show-case both C++ versus python and "basic" analysis (loop
through all objects) versus "advanced" analysis (based on iterators with selection filters
from the GriffAnaUtils package). They are:

  sb_griffanaex_testcppana_basic    ("basic" C++ analysis in app_testcppana_basic/main.cc   )
  sb_griffanaex_testpyana_basic     ( same but in python in scripts/testpyana_basic         )
  sb_griffanaex_testcppana_advanced ("advanced" C++ analysis in testcppana_advanced/main.cc )
  sb_griffanaex_testpyana_advanced  ( same but in python in scripts/testpyana_advanced      )

Another example shows how advanced analysis can even work with custom selection
filters (filters must be defined in C++):

  sb_griffanaex_customfilter (in app_customfilter/main.cc)
