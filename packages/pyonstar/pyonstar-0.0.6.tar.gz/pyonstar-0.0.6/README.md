# PyOnStar

Unofficial Python package for making OnStar API requests. This is a Python port of the original OnStarJS package.

> **Note:** This project was primarily developed through AI-assisted "vibe-coding" - using AI tools to help port the JavaScript codebase to Python while maintaining the original functionality.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyonstar
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from pyonstar import OnStar

async def main():
    # Create OnStar instance
    onstar = OnStar.create({
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "device_id": "your_device_id",
        "vin": "your_vin",
        "onstar_pin": "your_pin",  # Optional
        "totp_secret": "your_totp_secret"  # Optional
    })

    try:
        # Get account vehicles
        result = await onstar.get_account_vehicles()
        print(result)

        # Start vehicle
        result = await onstar.start()
        print(result)

        # Lock doors
        result = await onstar.lock_door()
        print(result)

        # Get vehicle location
        result = await onstar.location()
        print(result)
    finally:
        # Always close the client when done
        await onstar.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
