# Clipper

**Clipper** is a Python CLI tool for batch image generation using text prompts. It connects to `webui_forge` (a Stable Diffusion API backend) to generate images from single prompts or prompt files, and logs each result for easy tracking.

  - A single prompt (`--prompt`)
  - A file of prompts (`--prompts`)
- 🧠 Logs metadata to `prompt_log.jsonl`
- ⚙️ Configurable via a JSON file (`--config`)
- 🧪 Comes with unit + CLI tests (`pytest`)
- 🧰 Built for automation and reuse

```json
{
  "steps": 40,
  "width": 640,
  "height": 640,
  "cfg_scale": 8.5,
  "delay": 2
}
```
