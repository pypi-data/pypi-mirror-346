# Unstructured Expanded

The `unstructured_expanded` library is a wrapper around the `unstructured` open source library to add image-extraction capabilities to the API.

Its only purpose is to provide a more complete API for the `unstructured` library, since the library maintainers of the open source project
have chosen to lock image extraction for office documents behind a paywall.

## Quick-Start

This library is meant to be used in conjunction with the `unstructured` library.

Versions of this library are equivalent to the `unstructured` library version they are based on.

```shell
# Install the variant of unstructured with everything you need support for
pip install unstructured["all-docs"]

# Install the unstructured_expanded library on top of it
pip install unstructured_expanded
```

## License
