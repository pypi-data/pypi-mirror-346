                used for 'Experiment' session types. It is used to find the experiment configuration .YAML file.
            project_configuration: The initialized ProjectConfiguration instance that stores the session's project
                configuration data. This is used to determine the root directory paths for all lab machines used during
                data acquisition and processing.
            session_name: An optional session_name override. Generally, this argument should not be provided for most
                sessions. When provided, the method uses this name instead of generating a new timestamp-based name.
                This is only used during the 'ascension' runtime to convert old data structures to the modern
                lab standards.

        Returns:
            An initialized SessionData instance that stores the layout of the newly created session's data.

    def load(cls, session_path: Path, on_server: bool, make_directories: bool = True) -> SessionData:
        """Loads the SessionData instance from the target session's session_data.yaml file.

        This method is used to load the data layout information of an already existing session. Primarily, this is used
        when preprocessing or processing session data. Depending on the call location (machine), the method
        automatically resolves all necessary paths and creates the necessary directories.

        Notes:
            To create a new session, use the create() method instead.

            Although session_data.yaml is stored both inside raw_data and processed_data subfolders, this method
            always searches only inside the raw_data folder. Storing session data in both folders is only used to ensure
            human experimenters can always trace all data in the lab back to the proper project, animal, and session.

        Args:
            session_path: The path to the root directory of an existing session, e.g.: vrpc_root/project/animal/session.
            on_server: Determines whether the method is used to initialize an existing session on the BioHPC server or
                a non-server machine. Note, non-server runtimes use the same 'root' directory to store raw_data and
                processed_data subfolders. BioHPC server runtimes use different volumes (drives) to store these
                subfolders.
            make_directories: Determines whether to attempt creating any missing directories. Generally, this option
                is safe to be True for all destinations other than some specific BioHPC server runtimes, where some
                data is 'owned' by a general lab account and not the user account. These cases are only present for the
                sl-forgery library and are resolved by that library.

        Returns:
            An initialized SessionData instance for the session whose data is stored at the provided path.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the 'session_data.yaml' file is not found under the session_path/raw_data/ subfolder.

        """Saves the instance data to the 'raw_data' directory and the 'processed_data' directory of the managed session
         as a 'session_data.yaml' file.

        This is used to save the data stored in the instance to disk, so that it can be reused during preprocessing or
        data processing. The method is intended to only be used by the SessionData instance itself during its
        create() method runtime.

        This method is used instead of the default method inherited from the YamlConfig class. Primarily, this is used
        to avoid errors with old SessionData class formats that contain some data that is either no longer present or
        cannot be loaded from YAML. Using this custom method ensures we can load any SessionData class, provided it
        contains the required header fields.

        Returns:
            The SessionData instance initialized using the resolved header data.
