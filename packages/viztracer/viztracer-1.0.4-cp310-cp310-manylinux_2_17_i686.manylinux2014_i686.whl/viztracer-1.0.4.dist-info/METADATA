           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

VizTracer is a low-overhead logging/debugging/profiling tool that can trace and visualize your python code execution.

The front-end UI is powered by [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/). **Use "AWSD" to zoom/navigate**.
More help can be found in "Support - Controls".

[![example_img](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/example.png)](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/example.png)


## Highlights

* Detailed function entry/exit information on timeline with source code
* Super easy to use, no source code change for most features, no package dependency
* Low overhead, probably the fastest tracer in the market
* Supports threading, multiprocessing, subprocess, async and PyTorch
* Powerful front-end, able to render GB-level trace smoothly
* Works on Linux/MacOS/Windows

## Install

The preferred way to install VizTracer is via pip

```sh
pip install viztracer
```

## Basic Usage

### Command Line

```sh
# Instead of "python3 my_script.py arg1 arg2"
viztracer my_script.py arg1 arg2
```

<details>

<summary>
A <code>result.json</code> file will be generated, which you can open with <code>vizviewer</code>
</summary>

```sh
# You can display all the files in a directory and open them in browser too
vizviewer ./
# For very large trace files, try external trace processor
vizviewer --use_external_processor result.json
```

vizviewer will host an HTTP server on ``http://localhost:9001``. You can also open your browser and use that address.

If you do not want vizviewer to open the webbrowser automatically, you can use

```sh
vizviewer --server_only result.json
```

If you just need to bring up the trace report once, and do not want the persistent server, use

```sh
vizviewer --once result.json
```

</details>

```sh
vizviewer result.json
```

A [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gaogaotiantian.viztracer-vscode)
is available to make your life even easier.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer-vscode/raw/master/assets/demo.gif" />
</p>

<details>

<summary>
Add <code>--open</code> to open the reports right after tracing
</summary>

```sh
viztracer --open my_script.py arg1 arg2
viztracer -o result.html --open my_script.py arg1 arg2
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>
modules and console scripts(like <code>flask</code>) are supported as well
</summary>

```sh
viztracer -m your_module
```

```sh
viztracer flask run
```

</details>

### Inline

You can also manually start/stop VizTracer in your script as well.

```python
from viztracer import VizTracer

tracer = VizTracer()
tracer.start()
# Something happens here
tracer.stop()
tracer.save() # also takes output_file as an optional argument
```

Or, you can do it with ```with``` statement

```python
with VizTracer(output_file="optional.json") as tracer:
    # Something happens here
```

### Jupyter

If you are using Jupyter, you can use viztracer cell magics.

```python
# You need to load the extension first
%load_ext viztracer
```

```python
%%viztracer
# Your code after
```

A ``VizTracer Report`` button will appear after the cell and you can click it to view the results

### PyTorch

VizTracer can log native calls and GPU events of PyTorch (based on `torch.profiler`) with
``--log_torch``.

```python
with VizTracer(log_torch=True) as tracer:
    # Your torch code
```

```sh
viztracer --log_torch your_model.py
```

## Advanced Usage

### Trace Filter

VizTracer can filter out the data you don't want to reduce overhead and keep info of a longer time period before you dump the log.

* [Min Duration](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#min-duration)
* [Max Stack Depth](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#max-stack-depth)
* [Include Files](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#include-files)
* [Exclude Files](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#exclude-files)
* [Ignore C Function](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#ignore-c-function)
* [Sparse Log](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html#log-sparse)

### Extra Logs without Code Change

VizTracer can log extra information without changing your source code

* [Any Variable/Attribute with RegEx](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-variable)
* [Function Entry](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-function-entry)
* [Variables in Specified Function](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-function-execution)
* [Garbage Collector Operation](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-garbage-collector)
* [Function Input Arguments](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-function-arguments)
* [Function Return Value](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-function-return-value)
* [Audit Events](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-audit)
* [Raised Exceptions](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extra_log.html#log-exception)

### Add Custom Event

VizTracer supports inserting custom events while the program is running. This works like a print debug, but you can know when this print happens while looking at trace data.

* [Instant Event](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_event_intro.html#instant-event)
* [Variable Event](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_event_intro.html#variable-event)
* [Duration Event](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_event_intro.html#duration-event)

## Misc

### Multi Thread Support

For Python3.12+, VizTracer supports Python-level multi-thread tracing without the need to do any modification to your code.

For versions before 3.12, VizTracer supports python native ```threading``` module. Just start ```VizTracer``` before you create threads and it will just work.

For other multi-thread scenarios, you can use ``enable_thread_tracing()`` to notice VizTracer about the thread to trace it.

[![example_img](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/multithread_example.png)](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/multithread_example.png)

Refer to [multi thread docs](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concurrency.html) for details


### Multi Process Support

VizTracer supports ```subprocess```, ```multiprocessing```, ```os.fork()```, ```concurrent.futures```, and ```loky``` out of the box.

For more general multi-process cases, VizTracer can support with some extra steps.

[![example_img](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/multiprocess_example.png)](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/master/img/multiprocess_example.png)

Refer to [multi process docs](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concurrency.html) for details

### Async Support

VizTracer supports ```asyncio``` natively, but could enhance the report by using ```--log_async```.

Refer to [async docs](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concurrency.html) for details

### Flamegraph

Perfetto supports native flamegraph, just select slices on the UI and choose "Slice Flamegraph".

### Remote attach

VizTracer supports remote attach to an arbitrary Python process to trace it, as long as viztracer is importable

Refer to [remote attach docs](https://viztracer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/remote_attach.html)

### JSON alternative

VizTracer needs to dump the internal data to json format. It is recommended for the users to install ```orjson```, which is much faster than the builtin ```json``` library. VizTracer will try to import ```orjson``` and fall back to the builtin ```json``` library if ```orjson``` does not exist.

## Performance

VizTracer puts in a lot of effort to achieve low overhead. The actual performance impact largely depends on your application.
For typical codebases, the overhead is expected to be below 1x. If your code has infrequent function calls,
the overhead could be minimal.

Detailed explanation
</summary>

The overhead introduced by VizTracer is basically a fixed amount of time during function entry and exit, so the more time spent on
function entries and exits, the more overhead will be observed. A pure recursive ```fib``` function could suffer 3x-4x overhead
on Python3.11+ (when the Python call is optimized, before that Python call was slower so the overhead ratio would be less).

In the real life scenario, your code should not spend too much time on function calls (they don't really do anything useful), so
the overhead would be much smaller.

Many techniques are applied to minimize the overall overhead during code execution to reduce the inevitable skew introduced by
VizTracer (the report saving part is not as critical). For example, VizTracer tries to use the CPU timestamp counter instead of
a syscall to get the time when available. On Python 3.12+, VizTracer uses ```sys.monitoring``` which has less overhead than
```sys.setprofile```. All of the efforts made it observably faster than ```cProfile```, the Python stdlib profiler.

However, VizTracer is a tracer, which means it has to record every single function entry and exit, so it can't be as fast as
the sampling profilers - they are not the same thing. With the extra overhead, VizTracer provides a lot more information than
normal sampling profilers.
