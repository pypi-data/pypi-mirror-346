## Comparison with analytical solution

In addition to comparing to the legacy results from SLAMMER, it is also worth comparing pySLAMMER's results to analytical solutions to sliding block problems. 
In this section, we compare pySLAMMER's calculated sliding displacements for rigid sliding blocks for single cycle harmonic motions of frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 10 Hz to an analytical solution.

While analytical solutions to sliding block analyses are not possible for complex ground motions, they can be developed for simple harmonic motions and pulses @conte1989.
