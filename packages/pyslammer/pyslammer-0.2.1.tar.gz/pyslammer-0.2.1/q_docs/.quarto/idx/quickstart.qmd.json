Import the `pyslammer` module\n2. Import a ground motion\n3. Perform a rigid sliding block analysis\n4. View results\n\n### Import the pyslammer module\nThe recommended ailas for pyslammer is `slam`:\n\n```{python}\nimport pyslammer as slam \n```\n\nThis allows use of pyslammer features within your code with the short prefix `slam`.\n\nThe primary object type within pyslammer is the `SlidingBlockAnalysis` object.\nAt a minimum any `SlidingBlockAnalysis` requires a yield acceleration for the slope ($k_y$) and an input ground motion.\nAs basic example, consider a rigid sliding block analysis on a slope with a yield acceleration of $0.2$ g. \n\n### Import a ground motion\nA small number of sample ground motion records are included with `pyslammer`.\nWe will use one of the sample ground motion records, but we expect most users will import their ground motions from external sources. \nTo use any signal for a ground motion, `pyslammer` needs a 1-D array of acceleration in units of $g$ and the signal timestep (in seconds). \nSee The available sample ground motions can be viewed with:\n\n```{python}\nmotions = slam.sample_ground_motions() # Load all sample ground motions\nfor motion in motions:\n    print(motion)\n```\n\nFor this example, we will use the`Imperial_Valley_1979_BCR-230` motion.\n\n```{python}\ngm = motions[\"Imperial_Valley_1979_BCR-230\"]\n```\n\nThe timestep and acceleration signal for the imported ground motion are `gm.dt` and `gm.accel`, respectively.\n\n### Perform a rigid sliding block analysis\nWith the imported ground motion, `gm`, and the assumed value of $k_y$, we can perform a rigid sliding block analysis with pySLAMMER's `RigidAnalysis` object. \nThis simultaneously creates an instance of `RigidAnalysis` and performs the analysis, which is stored as `result`.\nThe inputs for `RigidAnalysis` are the input acceleration signal, time step, and the yield acceleration.\n\n```{note}\nA note admonition! Not for anyting in particular, though...\n```\n\n```{python}\nky = 0.2 # yield acceleration in g\nresult = slam.RigidAnalysis(ky, gm.accel, gm.dt)\n```\n\n### View results\nThe primary output of the sliding block analysis is the final displacement (`SlidingBlockAnalysis.max_sliding_disp`).\nBy default, all lengths in pySLAMMER are in meters.\nThe cell below shows the displacement induced by the sample ground motion in the example:\n\n```{python}\nprint(f\"Slope yield acc: {ky:.2f} g \\nGround motion: {gm.name}; PGA: {gm.pga:.2f} g \\nSliding displacement: {result.max_sliding_disp:.3f} m\")\n```\n\nA built-in plotting function presents an at-a-glance picture of the analysis result in terms of the input motion and block accelerations, sliding velocity, and sliding displacement:\n\n```{python}\n#| label: fig_quickstart_rigid\n#| fig-cap: \"Rigid sliding block analysis results\"\n#| column: page-right\nfig = result.sliding_block_plot()\n```\n\nIn addition to the final displacement, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration time histories of the block are returned as numpy arrays.\nSee the documentation for the `SlidingBlockAnalysis` class for a detailed description of all the results.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Requirements\nThe pyslammer package is built on Python 3.12.
