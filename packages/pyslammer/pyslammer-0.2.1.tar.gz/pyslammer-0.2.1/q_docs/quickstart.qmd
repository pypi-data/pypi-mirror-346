## Requirements
The pyslammer package is built on Python 3.12. Earlier versions of Python 3 may work, but have not been tested.

## Installation using pip

<!-- [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyslammer.svg){fig-align="left"}](https://pypi.org/project/pyslammer)
[![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pyslammer.svg){fig-align="left"}](https://pypi.org/project/pyslammer) -->

Install pyslammer using `pip` from the Python Package Index (PyPI):
``` bash
pip install pyslammer
```
## Basic Usage
With `pyslammer` installed, basic usage involves the following steps:
1. Import the `pyslammer` module
2. Import a ground motion
3. Perform a rigid sliding block analysis
4. View results

### Import the pyslammer module
The recommended ailas for pyslammer is `slam`:

```{python}
import pyslammer as slam 
```

This allows use of pyslammer features within your code with the short prefix `slam`.

The primary object type within pyslammer is the `SlidingBlockAnalysis` object.
At a minimum any `SlidingBlockAnalysis` requires a yield acceleration for the slope ($k_y$) and an input ground motion.
As basic example, consider a rigid sliding block analysis on a slope with a yield acceleration of $0.2$ g. 

### Import a ground motion
A small number of sample ground motion records are included with `pyslammer`.
We will use one of the sample ground motion records, but we expect most users will import their ground motions from external sources. 
To use any signal for a ground motion, `pyslammer` needs a 1-D array of acceleration in units of $g$ and the signal timestep (in seconds). 
See The available sample ground motions can be viewed with:

```{python}
motions = slam.sample_ground_motions() # Load all sample ground motions
for motion in motions:
    print(motion)
```

For this example, we will use the`Imperial_Valley_1979_BCR-230` motion.

```{python}
gm = motions["Imperial_Valley_1979_BCR-230"]
```

The timestep and acceleration signal for the imported ground motion are `gm.dt` and `gm.accel`, respectively.

### Perform a rigid sliding block analysis
With the imported ground motion, `gm`, and the assumed value of $k_y$, we can perform a rigid sliding block analysis with pySLAMMER's `RigidAnalysis` object. 
This simultaneously creates an instance of `RigidAnalysis` and performs the analysis, which is stored as `result`.
The inputs for `RigidAnalysis` are the input acceleration signal, time step, and the yield acceleration.

```{note}
A note admonition! Not for anyting in particular, though...
```

```{python}
ky = 0.2 # yield acceleration in g
result = slam.RigidAnalysis(ky, gm.accel, gm.dt)
```

### View results
The primary output of the sliding block analysis is the final displacement (`SlidingBlockAnalysis.max_sliding_disp`).
By default, all lengths in pySLAMMER are in meters.
The cell below shows the displacement induced by the sample ground motion in the example:

```{python}
print(f"Slope yield acc: {ky:.2f} g \nGround motion: {gm.name}; PGA: {gm.pga:.2f} g \nSliding displacement: {result.max_sliding_disp:.3f} m")
```

A built-in plotting function presents an at-a-glance picture of the analysis result in terms of the input motion and block accelerations, sliding velocity, and sliding displacement:

```{python}
#| label: fig_quickstart_rigid
#| fig-cap: "Rigid sliding block analysis results"
#| column: page-right
fig = result.sliding_block_plot()
```

In addition to the final displacement, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration time histories of the block are returned as numpy arrays.
See the documentation for the `SlidingBlockAnalysis` class for a detailed description of all the results.
