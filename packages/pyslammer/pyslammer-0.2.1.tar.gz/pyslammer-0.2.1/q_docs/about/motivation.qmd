Why did we make pySLAMMER?

* Sliding block analyses are common
* The code used isn't always transparent
* SLAMMER is clunky
* There are a lot of additions to traditional sliding block analyses that have been introduced here and there, but they're not all in one place.
* Reduced duplication of effort
* More eyes looking for errors
