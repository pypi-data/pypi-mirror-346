# CASAS-PBDM repository

CASAS-PBDM is a general tritrophic system modeling library that uses the
physiologically based demographic modeling (PBDM) approach and unifies
existing CASAS-PBDM system models.

CASAS-PBDM implements the physiologically based demographic modeling (PBDM)
approach of Gutierrez (1996), and generalizes from an existing set of
CASAS-PBDM system models coded in Pascal that have been developed for decades
in the Laboratory of Andrew Paul Gutierrez at University of California,
Berkeley and by international collaborators for published PBDM system
analyses and are now owned by CASAS Global (https://www.casasglobal.org/).

In terms of implementation, the main building block of the CASAS-PBDM general
population modeling library is be the concept of functional population
(see Gutierrez 1996).
