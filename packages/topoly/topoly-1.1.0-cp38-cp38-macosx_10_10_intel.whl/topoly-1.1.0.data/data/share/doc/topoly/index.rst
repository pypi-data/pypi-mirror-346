.. Topoly documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Jan 29 18:30:03 2020.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

**NEW: 07.05.2025**: We are pleased to announce the availability of Topoly 1.1.0. This version introduces new functionality and
fixes several incompatibilities with the latest versions of the dependencies: NumPy 2.x and Matplotlib 3.10. It is also the
first version supported on Python 3.13.

**NEW!!!** Since version 1.0.4 Topoly is available also for **M1/M2 Apple Silicon Mac** and **Windows 64 Bit**.
Look at the `Topoly requirements <https://topoly.cent.uw.edu.pl/installation.html>`_ for details.


Welcome to Topoly
==================================
Topoly is a **Python** package that collects programs useful for 
**polymer topology** analysis. We wanted to make it simple in use, but powerful
at the same time. 

We provide twofold tutorial for our package. `In the first part 
<https://topoly.cent.uw.edu.pl/tutorial.html>`_ all functions are briefly 
presented with explanation of idea how do they work. The second part is 
`topoly_tutorial package <https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/>`_ with 
examples of Topoly package usage.


What you can do with Topoly?
----------------------------------

* Find knots, links, lassos, theta-curves, handcuffs and their type.
* Calculate knot/link invariants:

  * Polynomials: Alexander, Jones, Conway, HOMFLY, Yamada, Kauffman, BLM/Ho,
  * Brackets: Kauffman, APS,
  * Other: writhe, Gaussian linking number.

* Find minimal surface of a loop.
* Simplify polymer structure preserving its topology.
* Generate random polygon structures: walks, loops, lassos, handcuffs.
* Generate knot map (like in KnotProt).
* Calculate sum (U) and product (#) of knots.
* Visualize structures.
