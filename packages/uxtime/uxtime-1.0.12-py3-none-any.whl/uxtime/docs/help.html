        <h3>What it does</h3>
        <p>The Unixtimeconverter calculates time from an provided isotimeformat into unixtime and viceversa. To do this the application needs 2 inputs - the timezone and a unixtime or a time(UTC or local)</p>

        <h3>What is time...?</h3>
        <p>
            UTC - a time which is valid over the world (with no timezones) - also known as Z-time<br>
            Local time - the time from your current (or selected) timezone<br>
            Unixtime - the unixtime represents a numeric value which are the seconds starting with 1970-01-01 00:00:00 - it is also know as "The Epoch".<br><br>
            We only calculate unixtime until "5138-11-16 10:46:39" - after this time somebody else has to take care. Further the software does not accept a time before 1970-01-01 00:00:01.
            A timestamp before 0 is not possible - "The Epoch" starts with the time above!. The lowest value which can be converted is 1.
        </p>

        <p>
            The application does not convert milliseconds. This is not intended.
        </p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
            The application need only 2 parameters for the calculation:
            a timezone - pleas select one <br>
            and a time - equal which one - the local time, the UTC or an unix timestamp. Fill in in one of the 3 textfields and click on the button beside. Done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Button Reset:<br>
            Basically it's not needed to click on the resetbutton. It's for more clearance for the usage. If you click on it all entriefields for time (localtime, utc-time and unixtime) are cleared.<br><br>
            If you change one timefield (and both other timefields containing values) and you click on the button beside of this field all other (time-)fields are recalculated.
        </p>
