% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to fix a code_module given a list of potential issues.

% Here is the program that is running the code_module: <program>{program}</program>

% Here is the prompt that generated the program and code_module: <prompt>{prompt}</prompt>

% Here is the code_module that is being used by the program: <code_module>{code}</code_module>

% Here are the output logs from the program run: <output>{output}</output>

% Here are the potential issues that need to be fixed: <issues>{issues}</issues>

% Follow these steps to fix the program or code_module:
    Step 1. Analyze and understand each identified issue in the context of the code_module and program.
    Step 2. For each issue, develop a solution that addresses the root cause while still satisfying the prompt requirements.
    Step 3. Implement the fixes, ensuring the changes resolve the issues without introducing new problems.
    Step 4. Provide the complete fixed code_module and program with explanations for each significant change made.
    Step 5. Verify that the fixed code meets all requirements from the original prompt and addresses all identified issues.

% Return your response as a single, valid JSON object.
% The JSON object must conform to the following structure:
% {{
%   "explanation": "Detailed explanation of all steps taken, including analysis of issues, solutions developed, and verification that the fixes are correct and meet prompt requirements.",
%   "fixed_code": "The complete, runnable, and fixed Python code for the code_module. This should ONLY be the code, with no additional text or commentary.",
%   "fixed_program": "The complete, runnable, and fixed Python code for the program. This should ONLY be the code, with no additional text or commentary."
% }}
% Ensure that the "fixed_code" and "fixed_program" fields contain only the raw source code. Do not include any markdown formatting, comments (unless part of the code itself), or any other explanatory text within these fields.
