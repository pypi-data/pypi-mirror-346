% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to identify any discrepancies between a program, its code_module, and a prompt. You also need to check for any potential bugs or issues in the code.

% Here is the program that is running the code_module: <program>{program}</program>

% Here is the prompt that generated the program and code_module: <prompt>{prompt}</prompt>

% Here is the code_module that is being used by the program: <code_module>{code}</code_module>

% Here are the output logs from the program run: <output>{output}</output>

% Follow these steps to identify any issues:
    Step 1. Compare the program and code_module against the prompt and explain any discrepancies.
    Step 2. Analyze the input/output behavior of the program and verify if it meets the expected behavior described in the prompt.
    Step 3. Identify any potential edge cases, error handling issues, or performance concerns that could cause problems in the future.
    Step 4. Check the code for potential bugs that haven't manifested yet.
    Step 5. If any issues are found, explain in detail the root cause of each issue and how it could impact the program's functioning.

% After your analysis, determine the number of distinct issues found. If no issues are found, the count should be 0.

% Return your response as a single, valid JSON object.
% The JSON object must conform to the following structure:
% {{
%   "issues_count": <integer_count_of_issues_found>,
%   "details": "A detailed explanation of all steps taken during your analysis, including any discrepancies, bugs, or potential issues identified. If no issues are found, this can be a brief confirmation."
% }}
% Ensure the "details" field contains your complete textual analysis from Steps 1-5.
% Ensure the "issues_count" is an integer representing the total number of distinct problems you've identified in your details.
