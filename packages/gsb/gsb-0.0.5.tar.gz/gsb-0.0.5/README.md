A tool for managing incremental backups of your save states _using Git!_

## In a Nutshell

Does Steam keep corrupting your cloud saves?

Does it take too long to create or restore a Minecraft backup?

Do you want to rewind your game five hours and explore _what might have been_ if
only you'd punched that NPC in the face?

If that sounds like you, then GSB is here to help! This is a lightweight wrapper
around the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system that's optimized for
game saves. Features (will) include:

- automated incremental backups
- painless savegame restores
- easy history navigation
- revision history compression and cleaning
- support for branches
- workflows for implementing [3-2-1 backups](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/my-backup-plan)
- full compatibility with Git and other git-based tools...
- ... all without ever needing to know a thing about Git


## Installation

The `gsb` package is written for **Python 3.11 or newer** but otherwise
should run on any operating system and architecture.

The easiest way to install it is via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
$ pipx install gsb
```

For more help (including instructions for installing an up-to-date version
of Python), check out the
[Installation Guide](https://openbagtwo.github.io/gsb/release/installation).

## Usage

The recommended way to interact with GSB is via its  command-line interface.
Once you've installed the package, run the following command to get an overview of the
available actions:

```bash
$ gsb --help
```

and use:

```bash
$ gsb <verb> --help
```
(_e.g._ `gsb backup --help`)

for further details on running each of those commands.

Full documentation, including tutorials, examples and full CLI docs, can be
