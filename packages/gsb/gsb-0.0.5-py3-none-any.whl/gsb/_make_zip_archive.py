    """Implementation of `repo.write_archive` that supports ZIP. Writes treeish
    into an archive.

    If no timestamp is provided and 'treeish' is a commit, its committer
    timestamp will be used. Otherwise the current time will be used.

    All path names in the archive are added to 'prefix', which defaults to
    an empty string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo: Repository
        The git repository
    treeish
        The treeish to write
    archive : zipfile.ZipFile
        An archive from the 'zipfile' module.
    timestamp : int, optional
        (Epoch) timestamp to use for the files in the archive.
    prefix : str, optional
        Extra prefix to add to the path names in the archive.
