    Runtime environment for Ulula.
    
    This function executes the hydro solver for a given problem setup and user-defined parameters. 
    Depending on user choices, it produces output files, plots, and movies. Customizations that are 
    implemented in the setup class (e.g., which variables to plot with which colormaps) are automatically 
    routed to the respective plotting routines. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    setup: Setup
        Setup object. See :doc:`setups` for how to create this object.
    hydro_scheme: HydroScheme
        :class:`~ulula.core.simulation.HydroScheme` object that contains choices for the hydro
        solver, the CFL number, and so on. If None, the standard scheme is used. See 
        :doc:`simulation` for details.
    nx: int
        Number of cells in the x-direction. The ratio of x and y is determined by the problem 
        setup.
    tmax: float
        Time when the simulation should be stopped (in code units).
    max_steps: int
        Maximum number of steps to take. If None, no limit is imposed and the code is run to 
        a time ``tmax``. 
    restart_file: str
        If not None, the simulation is loaded from this filename and restarted at the step
        where it was saved.
    print_step: int
        Print a line to the console every ``print_step`` timesteps.
    check_conservation: bool
        If True, we compute the total mass, energy and so on each ``print_step`` timesteps and
        compare it to the initial energy. Note that the conserved quantities depend on the 
        boundary conditions of the simulation setup: mass, energy and momentum are conserved in
        periodic BCs, only mass and energy in wall BCs, and nothing is conserved in outflow BCs.
        Similarly, gravity can break the conservation laws.
    output_step: int
        Output a snapshot/restart file every ``output_step`` timesteps. Note that this spacing 
        probably does not correspond to fixed times. If the latter is desired, use 
        ``output_time``. Both ``output_step`` and ``output_time`` can be used at the same time 
        to produce two sets of files.
    output_time: float
        Produce output files in time intervals of size ``output_time`` (given in code units). This 
        parameter should not change the progression of the simulation because the timesteps taken
        to arrive at the desired times are not used for the actual simulation.
    output_suffix: string
        String to add to all output filenames.
    plot_step: int
        Produce a plot every ``plot_step`` timesteps. Note that this spacing probably does not
        correspond to fixed times. If the latter is desired, use ``plot_time``. Both ``plot_step``
        and ``plot_time`` can be used at the same time to produce two sets of plots.
    plot_time: float
        Produce plots in time intervals of size ``plot_time`` (given in code units). This 
        parameter should not change the progression of the simulation because the timesteps taken
        to arrive at the desired times are not used for the actual simulation.
    plot_ics: bool
        Produce a plot of the initial conditions (if ``plot_step`` and/or ``plot_time`` are set).
    plot_1d: bool
        If ``True``, the 1D plotting routine is called at the specified time or step intervals.
        This parameter is ignored for 1D simulations.
    plot_2d: bool
        If ``True``, the 2D plotting routine is called at the specified time or step intervals.
        This parameter is ignored for 1D simulations.
    save_plots: bool
        If ``True``, plots are saved to a file (see also ``plot_suffix``, ``plot_file_ext``,
        and ``plot_dpi``). If ``False``, plots are shown in an interactive matplotlib window. Note
        that this can happen many times during a simulation depending on the values of ``plot_step`` 
        and/or ``plot_time``.
    plot_suffix: string
        String to add to all plot filenames (only active if ``save_plots == True``).
    plot_file_ext: string
        File extension for plots. Can be ``png``, ``pdf``, or any other extension supported by 
        the matplotlib library (only active if ``save_plots == True``).
    plot_dpi
        Dots per inch for png figures or other bitmap-like image formats (only active if 
        ``save_plots == True`` and ``plot_file_ext == 'png'``).
    plot_callback_func: function
        If not None, this must be a function that can be called with the signature
        ``plot_callback_func(sim, fig, panels, plot_type)``, meaning that it accepts as parameters a
        simulation object, a matplotlib figure, a list of matplotlib axes objects, and a string 
        that may be ``'1d'``, ``'2d'``, or ``'movie'`` to identify what kind of plot has been created. 
        The function is called after every time a plot is created and before it is saved or shown.
    movie: bool
        If ``True``, a movie is created by outputting frames at equally spaced times and running 
        a tool to combine them (see ``movie_file_ext``).
    movie_1d: bool
        If ``True``, the 1D plotting routine is called instead of the 2D plotting routine for a
        2D simulation. This parameter is ignored for 1D simulations.
    movie_length: float
        Length of the movie in seconds (not code units!).
    movie_file_ext: str
        Movie format, which can be ``'mp4'`` or ``'gif'``. If ``'mp4'``, the ffmpeg software must
        be installed to compile image files into a movie. If ``'gif'``, the python package pillow is used.
        The mp4 format offers much better compression (and thus smaller file size) at fixed 
        quality.
    movie_fps: int
        Framerate of the movie (25 is typical). The code can output at most one frame per 
        simulation timestep, which should not normally be an issue. A movie with a finer time 
        resolution could be produced by lowering the CFL number to force smaller timesteps and 
        increasing the framerate.
    movie_dpi: int
        Resolution of the png files used to create the movie.
    kwargs: kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments that are passed to the Ulula plotting functions 
        :func:`~ulula.core.plots.plot1d` and/or :func:`~ulula.core.plots.plot2d`. Keyword arguments 
        must appear in either function signature.
