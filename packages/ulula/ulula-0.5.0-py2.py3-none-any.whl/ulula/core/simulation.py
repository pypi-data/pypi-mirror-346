class HydroScheme():

    ----------
    reconstruction: string
        Reconstruction algorithm; see table for valid choices
    limiter: string
        Slope limiter algorithm; see table for valid choices
    riemann: string
        Riemann solver; see table for valid choices
    time_integration: string
        Time integration scheme; see table for valid choices
    cfl: float
        CFL number (must be between 0 and 1), which determines the maximum allowable timestep such 
        that the distance traveled by the maximum signal speed in the domain does not exceed the 
        CFL number times the size of a cell.
    cfl_max: float
        Maximum CFL number (must be between 0 and 1, and greater than ``cfl``). While each timestep
        is (typically) set to satisfy the CFL condition, each timestep actually consists of two
        sweeps in the two dimensions (x and y). Since the fluid state changes during the first 
        sweep, satisfying the CFL condition in the first sweep does not guarantee that it is still 
        satisfied during the second sweep. To avoid repeating the first sweep, we tolerate an actual, 
        updated CFL factor that is larger than ``cfl``, but it must still be smaller than
        ``cfl_max`` and smaller than unity, because exceeding unity will definitely break the hydro
        solver. Setting ``cfl_max`` to a value close to unity (e.g., 0.99) may still lead to 
        instabilities. On the other hand, choosing ``cfl`` and ``cfl_max`` to be close may mean 
        that more timesteps need to be repeated, which slows down the code.
    cfl_reduce_factor: float
        If ``cfl_max`` is exceeded during the second sweep, we reduce the previous estimate of the
        timestep by this factor. Must be larger than unity.
    cfl_max_attempts: int
        If we still encounter a CFL violation after reducing the timestep, we keep doing so
        ``cfl_max_attempts`` times. After the last attempt, the simulation is aborted.

        The pure Euler equations (i.e., ignoring viscosity, cooling, etc.) are invariant under 
        multiplications of up to three scale quantities, meaning that the solution of a hydro 
        problem remains unchanged independent of what physical length, time, and mass scales the 
        given numbers represent. One can alternatively think of rescalings in other, combined 
        quantities such as density, pressure, and so on. 

        This function lets the user define the meaning of the internal length, time, and mass 
        scales. The solution will not change unless the problem in question depends on physics 
        beyond the pure Euler equations, such as gravity. As a result, the values of the code units 
        are not used at all in the simulation class. However, plots of the solution will change if 
        a unit system other than code units is used.
        
        The code units are given in cgs units. Some common units are defined in the

        If ``'fixed_acc'`` is chosen, an acceleration ``g`` is uniformly applied. If the simulation is

        If ``'poisson'`` is chosen, the Poisson equation is solved at each timestep so that the 
        density field in the simulation generates a gravitational field with a gravitational 
        constant ``G``. This mode works only with periodic boundary conditions.

        nx: int
            Number of grid points in x-direction. Must be at least 2.
        ny: int
            Number of grid points in y-direction. Choosing ``ny = 1`` leads to a 1D simulation.
        xmin: float

            Type of boundary conditions, which can be ``'periodic'``, ``'outflow'``, or ``'wall'``. 
            With periodic boundary conditions, the domain wraps around, meaning that flows out of 
            the right edge re-enter on the left and so on. Outflow means that flows at the domain
            edge continue. Be careful with ouflow BCs! They do not conserved mass, energy, or 
            momentum, and they can lead to weird effects if the flow is not actually out of 
            the domain. For example, if there is a flow into the domain at an edge, this flow will 
            continue adding mass indefinitely unless it is stopped by counter-acting pressures 
            (which may or may not be desired). Finally, wall boundary conditions reflect the fluid 
            flow. They conserve mass and energy but not momentum.

        * Outflow: we take the value of the physical cells at the edge and copy them into the

        This function creates left and right cell-edge states based on the cell-centered states. It

        slope to use, and interpolates linearly within each cell. This interpolation leads to

        advanced by half a timestep to get 2nd-order convergence in time. There are two ways

        according to the L/R states as an approximation for the flux differential across the cell 
        (the ``'hancock_cons'`` integration scheme). The differential is then used to updated the 
        conserved cell-edge states. However, this method necessitates a 
        primitive->conserved->primitive conversion and a flux calculation. By contrast, the 
        so-called primitive Hancock method uses the Euler equations in primitive variables to 
        estimate the change in time from the change across the cell (see

        multiplication by a "Green's function" in Fourier space (which only works with periodic
