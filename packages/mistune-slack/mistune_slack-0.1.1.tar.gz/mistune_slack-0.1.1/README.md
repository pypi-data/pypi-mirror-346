## Features

- Produces Slack Block Kit JSON for posting messages to Slack
- Renders Slack users, channels, broadcasts, and emojis
- Supports strikethrough, task lists, URLs, and code blocks
- Headings, paragraphs, block quotes, and dividers
- Ordered and bullet lists (with nesting and task-list support)
- Inline code and fenced code-block rendering
- Link conversion into Slack link elements
- Note: images not supported. It should be easy to add by subclassing `mistune_slack.renderer.SlackRenderer`
  and adding your own logic (such as you may want to upload the image somewhere as well)

## Install

```bash
uv add mistune-slack
```

## Usage

```python
from mistune_slack import render_slack_blocks_from_markdown

markdown = "# Hello, *world*!"
blocks = render_slack_blocks_from_markdown(markdown)
print(blocks)  # post `blocks` to Slack
```

### Advanced usage

```python
import mistune
