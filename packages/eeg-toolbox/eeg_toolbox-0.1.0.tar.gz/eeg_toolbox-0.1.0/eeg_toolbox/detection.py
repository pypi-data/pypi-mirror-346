    """
    Using Short-time Fourier transfrom, it examines the 3â€“8 Hz energy on all channels. If this is abnormal, the event is recorded.

    Args:
        data: EEG signal matrix [channel, time].
        sfreq: Sampling frequency of the EEG data.
        bands:  Describes the frequency bands. Eg.: bands={"delta" : [0, 4], "theta": [4, 8]})
        duration_sec: The number of seconds to process the the signals.

    Returns:
            results: Events returned by the detect_graphoelements function. All elements have this structure:
                {"channel_index": The index of the channel on which the event is occuring.
                "time_sec": The time of the event expressed in secundum.
                "energy_3_8Hz": The energy of the detected event between 3 and 8 Hz.
                "dominant_rhythm": What kind of wave is the detected event e.g. theta, delta etc.
