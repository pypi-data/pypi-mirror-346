# Introduction section
Why Fibonacci?
 The Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) appears everywhere in nature.
 From the spiral of galaxies to the arrangement of flower petals.
  But have you ever considered using it for document formatting?
   That's the absurd premise behind FML.
     And yet, there's something oddly satisfying about it.
        Don't you think?

# Code demonstration
```python
def fibonacci(n):
 if n <= 1:
  return n
 else:
  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

Fibonacci Nesting
 Level 1 - One space
  Level 2 - Two spaces
   Level 3 - Three spaces
     Level 5 - Five spaces
        Level 8 - Eight spaces
             Level 13 - Thirteen spaces
                          Level 21 - Twenty-one spaces

# A funny poem about indentation
Ode to Indentation
 Spaces to the left,
 A mathematical theft,
  Of nature's own design,
   A sequence so divine,
     My code now looks absurd,
        But follows nature's word,
             And though my colleagues stare in confusion,
                          I've achieved Fibonacci-infused perfection.

# Closing thoughts
Conclusion
 FML might be a joke,
  But it's a fully functional one.
   Try it yourself and see,
     How mathematical constraints,
        Can lead to unexpected creativity,
             And perhaps a new appreciation for the humble space character.
                          (Or drive you completely mad. Results may vary.)
