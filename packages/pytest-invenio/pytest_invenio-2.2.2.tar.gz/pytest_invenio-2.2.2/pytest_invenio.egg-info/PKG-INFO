Pytest fixtures for Invenio.

The package offers a number of features to help test Invenio based
applications:

- Less boilerplate: Using the fixtures you can keep your ``conftest.py`` short
  and focused.
- Database re-use: database tests are running inside a transaction which is
  rolled back after the test.
- End-to-end testing: Selenium tests can easily be switched on/off, and in case
  of test failures a screenshot is taken (with possibility to output in the
  console in base64-encoding - useful on e.g. TravisCI).
- Application configuration for testing (e.g. disable CSRF protection in forms
  and HTTPS requirement).
- JSON decoding support in Flask test client for easier API testing.
- Batteries included: further fixtures help with e.g. mail sending and CLI
  tests.

Further documentation is available on https://pytest-invenio.readthedocs.io/.

  fixture names.
- Deprecate previous fixtures named with `es` prefix.
- Remove upper pin of pytest.

Version 1.4.13 (released 2022-08-09)

- Fix pycodestyle dependency

Version 1.4.12 (released 2022-08-08)

- Fix flask-login dependency

  db session is flushed.

Version 1.4.9 (released 2022-05-02)

- Mark users as changed and commit through datastore (outside of context
  manager).

Version 1.4.8 (yanked 2022-05-02 due to UserFixture session close issues)

- Commit users through the datastore in the UserFixture.

Version 1.4.7 (released 2022-04-04)

- Fixes an import so that pytest-invenio is now usable without
  Invenio-Accounts installed.

Version 1.4.4 (released 2022-02-21)

- Remove pytest-celery because it's still an alpha release.

Version 1.4.0 (released 2020-09-16)

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Changes to use isort, pycodestyle and pydocstyle via
  pytest plugins. You need to update `pytest.ini` and remove the ``--pep8``
  from the addopts and instead add ``--isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle``:

  .. code-block:: ini

      addopts = --isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle ...

  In `./run-tests.sh` script you should also remove calls to pydocstyle and
  isort as both are now integrated with pytest.

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Upgrade dependencies: coverage, pytest-flask,
  check-manifest, pytest. You need to set the pytest-flask live server
  fixture scope in your pytest config:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [pytest]
     live_server_scope = function

- Decommission pytest-pep8 (last release in 2014) in favour of pycodestyle.

Version 1.3.4 (released 2020-09-15)

- Add `entrypoints` fixture to allow injecting extra entry points during
  testing so that you avoid manual registration of e.g. mappings and schemas.

Version 1.3.3 (released 2020-08-27)

- Add `docker-services-cli` as dependency to enable Invenio modules to
  perform reproducible tests.

Version 1.3.2 (released 2020-05-19)

- Move check-manifest, coverage, isort, pydocstyle, pytest-flask and
  pytest-pep8 from test to install requirements to provide them as centrally
  managed dependencies.

Version 1.3.1 (released 2020-05-12)

- Uninstalls numpy in Travis due to incompatibilities with
  elasticsearch-py.

Version 1.3.0 (released 2020-03-19)

- Uninstalls numpy in Travis due to incompatibilities with
  elasticsearch-py.
- Deprecated Python versions lower than 3.6.0. Now supporting 3.6.0.
- Set maximum version of Werkzeug to 1.0.0 due to incompatible imports.

Version 1.1.0 (released 2019-02-15)

  unreliable overwriting of celery_config fixture name.

- Fixes overwriting of celery_config fixture

Version 1.0.5 (released 2018-10-08)

  decouple dependencies for Invenio apps or modules that might not be using
  them.
