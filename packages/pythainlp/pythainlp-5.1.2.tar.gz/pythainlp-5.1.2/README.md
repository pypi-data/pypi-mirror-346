PyThaiNLP is a Python package for text processing and linguistic analysis, similar to [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) with a focus on Thai language.

PyThaiNLP เป็นไลบารีภาษาไพทอนสำหรับประมวลผลภาษาธรรมชาติ คล้ายกับ NLTK โดยเน้นภาษาไทย [ดูรายละเอียดภาษาไทยได้ที่ README_TH.MD](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/blob/dev/README_TH.md)

## Quick install

```sh
pip install pythainlp
```

## Getting Started

- PyThaiNLP requires Python 3.7+.
  - Python 2.7 users can use PyThaiNLP 1.6. See [2.0 change log](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/issues/118) | [Upgrading from 1.7](https://pythainlp.org/docs/2.0/notes/pythainlp-1_7-2_0.html) | [Upgrading ThaiNER from 1.7](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/wiki/Upgrade-ThaiNER-from-PyThaiNLP-1.7-to-PyThaiNLP-2.0)

## Capabilities

PyThaiNLP provides standard linguistic analysis for Thai language and standard Thai locale utility functions.
Some of these functions are also available via the command-line interface (run `thainlp` in your shell).

Partial list of features:

- Convenient character and word classes, like Thai consonants (`pythainlp.thai_consonants`), vowels (`pythainlp.thai_vowels`), digits (`pythainlp.thai_digits`), and stop words (`pythainlp.corpus.thai_stopwords`) -- comparable to constants like `string.letters`, `string.digits`, and `string.punctuation`
- Linguistic unit segmentation at different levels: sentence (`sent_tokenize`), word (`word_tokenize`), and subword (`subword_tokenize`)
- Part-of-speech tagging (`pos_tag`)
- Spelling suggestion and correction (`spell` and `correct`)
- Phonetic algorithm and transliteration (`soundex`  and `transliterate`)
- Collation (sorted by dictionary order) (`collate`)
- Number read out (`num_to_thaiword` and `bahttext`)
- Datetime formatting (`thai_strftime`)
- Thai-English keyboard misswitched fix (`eng_to_thai`, `thai_to_eng`)

## Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade pythainlp
```

This will install the latest stable release of PyThaiNLP.

Install different releases:

- Stable release: `pip install --upgrade pythainlp`
- Pre-release (nearly ready): `pip install --upgrade --pre pythainlp`
- Development (likely to break things): `pip install https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/archive/dev.zip`

### Installation Options

Some functionalities, like Thai WordNet, may require extra packages. To install those requirements, specify a set of `[name]` immediately after `pythainlp`:

```sh
pip install "pythainlp[extra1,extra2,...]"
```

Possible `extras`:

- `full` (install everything)
- `compact` (install a stable and small subset of dependencies)
- `attacut` (to support attacut, a fast and accurate tokenizer)
- `benchmarks` (for [word tokenization benchmarking](tokenization-benchmark.md))
- `icu` (for ICU, International Components for Unicode, support in transliteration and tokenization)
- `ipa` (for IPA, International Phonetic Alphabet, support in transliteration)
- `ml` (to support ULMFiT models for classification)
- `thai2fit` (for Thai word vector)
- `thai2rom` (for machine-learnt romanization)
- `wordnet` (for Thai WordNet API)

For dependency details, look at the `extras` variable in
[`setup.py`](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/blob/dev/setup.py).

## Data Directory

- Some additional data, like word lists and language models, may be automatically downloaded during runtime.
- PyThaiNLP caches these data under the directory `~/pythainlp-data` by default.
- The data directory can be changed by specifying the environment variable `PYTHAINLP_DATA_DIR`.
- See the data catalog (`db.json`) at <https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp-corpus>

## Command-Line Interface

Some of PyThaiNLP functionalities can be used via command line with the `thainlp` command.

For example, to display a catalog of datasets:

```sh
thainlp data catalog
```

To show how to use:

```sh
thainlp help
```

## Testing and test suites

We test core functionalities on all officially supported Python versions.

Some functionality requiring extra dependencies may be tested less frequently
due to potential version conflicts or incompatibilities between packages.

Test cases are categorized into three groups: core, compact, and extra.
You can find these tests in the [tests/](/tests/) directory.

For more detailed information on testing, please refer to the tests README:
[tests/README.md](./tests/README.md)

It provides a wide range of software, models, and datasets for Thai language. We first provide a brief historical context of tools for Thai language prior to the development of PyThaiNLP. We then outline the functionalities it provided as well as datasets and pre-trained language models. We later summarize its development milestones and discuss our experience during its development. We conclude by demonstrating how industrial and research communities utilize PyThaiNLP in their work. The library is freely available at https://github.com/pythainlp/pythainlp.",
