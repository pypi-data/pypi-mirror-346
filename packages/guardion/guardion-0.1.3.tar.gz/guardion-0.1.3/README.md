# Guardion - AI Firewall SDK

Guardion is a **lightning-fast, context-aware AI Firewall SDK**, built to protect LLM-based systems from prompt injection and misuse. Seamlessly integrates with leading agent frameworks.

In the background, Guardion uses a robust **Prompt Defense System** developed by the GuardionAI research team. Our production-grade detection engine, [ModernGuard](https://docs.guardion.ai/modern-guard), continuously evaluates threats using a multilayered architecture of classifiers, heuristics, and decoding pipelines.

‚úÖ **Tested and proven in production by major financial institutions.**

**Notes**
> Tested on a multilingual, multi-attack dataset of 50K prompts with 40+ attack classes in 8 languages.

> Evaluation data was built using real-world red team data from partners and the latest jailbreak and attack methods, including: encoding, prompt injection, jailbreaking, exfiltration & leakage, evasion & obfuscation, code and command injection, hard negatives (safe content), regular documents (safe content), regular chats (safe content), and more. [See more details here](https://docs.guardion.ai/modern-guard).

## Features

You need to install our SDK using our openai-agents extras with the following command:

```bash
pip install guardion[openai_agents]
```

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered
from guardionsdk.openai_agents import guardion_guardrail

agent = Agent(
    name="Secure AI Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful and safe assistant.",
    input_guardrails=[guardion_guardrail],
)
```

And use it as shown in the file `examples/openai_agents.sdk`.

### LangChain

We support Chat and simple LLM models from LangChain, in order to use it, you need to install our langchain extra.

```bash
pip install guardion[langchain]
```
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from guardionsdk.langchain import get_guarded_chat_llm
from guardionsdk.exceptions import InjectionDetectedError

GuardionOpenAI = get_guarded_chat_llm(
    ChatOpenAI
)
llm_guardion = GuardionOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

And in order to use it, just checkout our `examples/langhchain.py` file.
