# MI-Agent

An **agentic workflow** for materials-informatics (MI) engineers, built with **LangGraph** and powered by OpenAI models. MI-Agent codifies the end-to-end MI pipeline—data loading, merging, feature selection, EDA, AutoML baselining, hyperparameter tuning, and executive reporting—into reusable nodes orchestrated as a LangGraph. LangSmith integration tracks and records each step of the graph executions. The result? MI workflows that run in seconds instead of hours, boosting your productivity by an order of magnitude.

---

## 🚀 Why MI-Agent?

- **Agentic LangGraph design** lets you hit “play” on a full MI pipeline  
- **10× faster**: eliminate boilerplate and manual scripting  
- **Extensible nodes**: swap in your own extractors, metrics, or plots  
- **LangSmith-backed** for logging and tracing each step of the agent's reasoning  
- Production-ready: versionable, testable, pip-installable

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Conda** (Miniconda or Anaconda)  
- **Python 3.10**  
- **OpenAI API key** - to power the Agentic pipeline with LLM that drives decision-making and code generation
- **LangSmith API key** - to log and trace each step of the agent's reasoning using LangGraph

## 📘 Google Colab Tutorial

To help you get started quickly, we’ve prepared an interactive Google Colab tutorial:

**[Google Colab Tutorial: Getting Started with MI-Agent](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hasan-sayeed/mi_agent/blob/master/notebooks/mi_agent_tutorial.ipynb)**

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Install MI-Agent and all necessary dependencies on Colab  
- Write a valid `problem.txt` file describing your task and pointing to your data  
- Run the agent with a single command  
- View the generated EDA code, plots, and summary in your Google Drive output folder

The tutorial runs entirely in Colab—no local setup required. All you need is access to your Google Drive and valid OpenAI/LangSmith API keys.

---

## Quickstart: Installation via pip

1. Create & activate a conda environment  
   ```bash
   conda create -n mi_agent python=3.10 -y
   conda activate mi_agent
   ```

2. Install via pip
   ```bash
   pip install mi_agent
   ```

3. Configure your API keys

   **MI-Agent** will automatically look for a file named `.env` in your current working directory (or any parent) and load any keys it finds.  

   In the folder where you’ll run the CLI (or in any ancestor), create a file called **`.env`** containing:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=lsv2_…
   ```

4. Prepare your problem file
   
   MI-Agent requires a `.txt` file (an example is provided in the `sample_problem.txt` in the project root) which contains:

   - your problem description

   - relative paths to your CSV(s), **including any folder prefix** (e.g. `data/sample_data.csv`)

   Example `problem.txt`:
   ```bash
   You are tasked with predicting alloy strength from composition data...

   - data/sample_data_1.csv: Contains experimental results...
   - data/sample_data_2.csv: Contains formulation recipes...
   ```

5. Run the agent

   Now, start the `mi_agent` pipeline as below:
   ```bash
   mi_agent --problem-file <path/to/problem.txt> --output-dir <path/to/output_dir>
   ```

   **MI-Agent** will:

   - Identify & load the CSV(s) listed in the problem file
   - Merge files if needed
   - Select target & features
   - Propose & execute EDA
   - Save all generated code (`*.py`) for EDA analysis and images (`*.png`) generated during EDA into <output_dir>
   - Run multiple ML models, select top 5, tune hyperparameters, and choose the best model
   - Generate and save a 5-page technical summary into <output_dir>
   - Log all reasoning steps to LangSmith


## From source: clone & run

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasan-sayeed/mi_agent.git
   cd mi_agent
   ```

2. Create & activate the conda env from `environment.yml`
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n mi_agent
   conda activate mi_agent
   ```

3. Install in editable mode
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Configure your API keys

   **MI-Agent** will automatically look for a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.  

   In the root directory of the project, create a file called **`.env`** containing:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=lsv2_…
   ```

5. Prepare your problem file as above and then start the `mi_agent` pipeline as below:
   ```bash
   mi_agent --problem-file <path/to/problem.txt> --output-dir <path/to/output_dir>
   ```
