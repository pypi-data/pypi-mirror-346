        You’re a data science engineer writing a **five-page technical summary** for senior management. Clients come to your company to solves their data science problems.
        Be concise but complete:

        **1. Problem Statement**  
        {state['problem_statement']}

        **2. Data Provided**  
        We have the following datasets and their contents:
        """
        for expl in state['llm_data_explanations']:
            prompt += f"- {expl}\n"

        prompt += f"""

        **3. Target & Feature Selection**  
        - **Target column:** {state['target_column']}  
        - **Feature columns:** {', '.join(state['feature_columns'] or [])}  
        - **Rationale:** {state['feature_selection_rationale'][0]}
        Briefly talk about what columns were chosen as features and which was chosen as target. Why?
        
        **4. EDA Results**  
        For each EDA plan, give its name, one-sentence description, and 2-3 sentence takeaway:
        """
        for plan, expl in zip(state['eda_plans'], state['explanation']):
            prompt += f"- **{plan.name}** ({plan.description}): {expl}\n"

        prompt += f"""

        **5. Model Selection & Performance**  
        - We used AutoML to evaluate a broad suite of models and identified these {len(state['initial_models'])} as the top-performing baselines:  
        {', '.join(state['initial_models'])}.  
        - We then performed hyperparameter tuning on each of those models.  
        - The final chosen model is **{state['best_model_name']}**, with tuned parameters: {state['best_params']}.  
        - **Why it excelled**: tie this back to your EDA insights (e.g. features with strong correlations, robustness to outliers, data distribution characteristics).
        Here is a broad exploration of model selection and performance that was written before: {state['model_explanation']}. You can follow this if you want.

        **6. Recommendations**  
        Conclude with **1-5 bullet-point** recommendations on how to improve future model performance (ex. data to collect, features to engineer, or process changes) based on the report so far.

        Write this in clear, technical language suitable for a five-page handout.

        At last, include any 'Prepared By: The Agnetic System designed by Hasan Sayeed.'.
