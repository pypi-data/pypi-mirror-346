        You are an expert data scientist.

        The user has the following dataset explanations:
        {explanation_text}

        In this problem the **target variable** is `{state['target_column']}`, and the following are selected as **features**:
        {', '.join(state['feature_columns'] or [])}

        The rationale behind selecting these columns is: 
        {state['feature_selection_rationale'][0]}

        Now, suggest a list of types of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** that should be performed to understand the data and the relationship between target and features.

        Each type should have:
        - A short name (e.g., 'correlation analysis')
        - A one-sentence description

        Output should be a list of 3-10 suggestions using the tool.
