        "\n",
        "- Interpret the scientific problem and understand the data context\n",
        "- Load and (if needed) merge structured datasets\n",
        "- Automatically select the appropriate target and feature columns\n",
        "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate visualizations\n",
        "- Run multiple machine learning models, select the top 5 performers, tune their hyperparameters, and identify the best final model\n",
        "- Save all generated code, plots, and intermediate outputs\n",
        "- Produce a detailed technical report of the full process\n",
