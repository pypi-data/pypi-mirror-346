                You're a data scientist. Write Python code to perform the EDA on the problem: {cfg['problem_statement']}

                Write a self‐contained Python script that:

                1. Forces Matplotlib into headless mode by doing:
                ```python
                import matplotlib
                matplotlib.use("Agg")```
                before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`.
                2. Imports any other needed libraries (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn, etc.). 
                3. Loads the data from {cfg['file_paths']} into a DataFrame. 
                4. Perform exactly one clear and simple EDA task: {eda_task} on the target {cfg['target_column']} and features {cfg['feature_columns']}. 
                5. Plot exactly one plot (where necessary). Ensure the figure dimensions are clear, e.g.:
                ```plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
                ```
                6. After plotting:
                ```plt.savefig("{cfg['eda_plan_name']}.png")
                plt.close()
                ```
                7. Do NOT use `plt.show()`.
                Include any printing of summary statistics or DataFrame heads you think are appropriate, but ensure the script ends by writing one PNG file.
