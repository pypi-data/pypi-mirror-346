If a product is found using the barcode,
a new line with that product will be added to the Sales Order.

By default, each product scan adds a new line to the sales order.
However, you can change this behavior in the sales settings.
To have the system increase the quantity of an existing product line
instead of creating a new one, follow these steps:
#. Go to the Sales Settings section.
#. Locate the option labeled "Increase quantity instead of creating a new line".
#. Check the box to activate this option and save to apply the changes.
