### Testing
Before running the tests, make sure that the utils.py can find the root directory. Either set the PROJECT_ROOT environement variable to the root directory, or simply create a config or a logs directory within the project root. Then run the pytests.

Prerequisite: make sure that you give your Operating System user the right to modify files in the python directory. The directory where pyhton is installed.
Use 
```python setup.py bdist_wheel```
 to create the dist, build and .eggs folder.
