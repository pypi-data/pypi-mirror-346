```
 and then
```
pip3 uninstall -y -r to-uninstall.txt
```

or 
```
pip3 install pip-autoremove
```

### Testing
Before running the tests, make sure that the utils.py can find the root directory. Either set the PROJECT_ROOT environement variable to the root directory, or simply create a config or a logs directory within the project root. Then run the pytests. 

### Build Library
Prerequisite: make sure that you give your Operating System user the right to modify files in the python directory. The directory where pyhton is installed.
Use 
```python setup.py bdist_wheel```
 to create the dist, build and .eggs folder.
