    Parameters
    ----------
    parameter : a character list or a single character string
                which represents the parameter code of the air
                pollutant related to the data being requested.
    bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the data
            selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.
    edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
            selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
    stateFIPS : a python character object which represents the 2 digit
                state FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being
                requested. Use aqs_states() for the list of available
                FIPS codes.
    countycode : a python character object which represents the 3 digit
                 state FIPS code for the county being requested
                 (with leading zero(s)). Use aqs_counties_by_state() for
                 the list of available county codes for each state.
    cbdate : a python date object which represents a "beginning date of
             last change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cbdate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or after this date will be returned.
             This is an optional variable which defaults to None.
    cedate : a python date object which represents an "end date of last
             change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cedate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or before this date will be
             returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
             to None.
    return_header : If FALSE (default) only returns data requested. If TRUE
                    returns a AQSAPI_v2 object.

    Notes
    -----
    The AQS API only allows for a single year of pep audit data
    to be retrieved at a time. This function conveniently extracts date
    information from the bdate and edate parameters then makes repeated
    calls to the AQSAPI retrieving a maximum of one calendar year of data
    at a time. Each calendar year of data requires a separate API call so
    multiple years of data will require multiple API calls. As the number
    of years of data being requested increases so does the length of time
    that it will take to retrieve results. There is also a 5 second wait
    time inserted between successive API calls to prevent overloading the
    API server. This operation has a linear run time of
    /(Big O notation: O/(n + 5 seconds/)/).

    Parameters
    ----------
    parameter : a character list or a single character string
                which represents the parameter code of the air
                pollutant related to the data being requested.
    bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the data
            selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.
    edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
            selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
    stateFIPS : a python character object which represents the 2 digit
                state FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being
                requested. Use aqs_states() for the list of available
                FIPS codes.
    countycode : a python character object which represents the 3 digit
                 state FIPS code for the county being requested
                 (with leading zero(s)). Use aqs_counties_by_state() for
                 the list of available county codes for each state.
    cbdate : a python date object which represents a "beginning date of
             last change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cbdate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or after this date will be returned.
             This is an optional variable which defaults to None.
    cedate : a python date object which represents an "end date of last
             change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cedate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or before this date will be
             returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
             to None.
    return_header : If FALSE (default) only returns data requested. If TRUE
                    returns a AQSAPI_v2 object.

    Notes
    -----
    The AQS API only allows for a single year of quarterly summary to be
    retrieved at a time. This function conveniently extracts date
    information from the bdate and edate parameters then makes repeated
    calls to the AQSAPI retrieving a maximum of one calendar year of data
    at a time. Each calendar year of data requires a separate API call so
    multiple years of data will require multiple API calls. As the number
    of years of data being requested increases so does the length of time
    that it will take to retrieve results. There is also a 5 second wait
    time inserted between successive API calls to prevent overloading the
    API server. This operation has a linear run time of
    /(Big O notation: O/(n + 5 seconds/)/).

    Also Note that for quarterly data, only the year portion of the bdate
    and edate are used and all 4 quarters in the year are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------

    bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the data
            selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.
    edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
            selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
    stateFIPS : a python character object which represents the 2 digit
                state FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being
                requested. Use aqs_states() for the list of available
                FIPS codes.
    countycode : a python character object which represents the 3 digit
                 state FIPS code for the county being requested
                 (with leading zero(s)). Use aqs_counties_by_state() for
                 the list of available county codes for each state.
    cbdate : a python date object which represents a "beginning date of
             last change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cbdate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or after this date will be returned.
             This is an optional variable which defaults to None.
    cedate : a python date object which represents an "end date of last
             change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cedate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or before this date will be
             returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
             to None.
    return_header : If FALSE (default) only returns data requested. If TRUE
                    returns a AQSAPI_v2 object.
