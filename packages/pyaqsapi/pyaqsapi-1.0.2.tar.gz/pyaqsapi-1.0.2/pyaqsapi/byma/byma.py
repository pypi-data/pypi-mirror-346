    Parameters
    ----------
    parameter : a character list or a single character string
                which represents the parameter code of the air
                pollutant related to the data being requested.
    bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the data
            selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.
    edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
            selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
    MA_code : a python character object which represents the 4 digit AQS
              Monitoring Agency code (with leading zeroes).
    cbdate : a python date object which represents a "beginning date of
             last change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cbdate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or after this date will be returned.
             This is an optional variable which defaults to None.
    cedate : a python date object which represents an "end date of last
             change" that indicates when the data was last updated.
             cedate is used to filter data based on the change date.
             Only data that changed on or before this date will be
             returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
             to None.
