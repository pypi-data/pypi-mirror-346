    Return a DataFrame of quarterly data aggregated at the state level.

    Quarterly summary contains a DataFrame matching the input parameter,
    stateFIPS a provided for bdate - edate time frame. Variables returned
    include mean value, maxima, percentiles, and etc.

    Notes
    -----
    The AQS API only allows for a single year of quarterly summary to be
    retrieved at a time. This function conveniently extracts date
    information from the bdate and edate parameters then makes repeated
    calls to the AQSAPI retrieving a maximum of one calendar year of data
    at a time. Each calendar year of data requires a separate API call so
    multiple years of data will require multiple API calls. As the number
    of years of data being requested increases so does the length of time
    that it will take to retrieve results. There is also a 5 second wait
    time inserted between successive API calls to prevent overloading the
    API server. This operation has a linear run time of
    /(Big O notation: O/(n + 5 seconds/)/).

    Also Note that for quarterly data, only the year portion of the bdate
    and edate are used and all 4 quarters in the year are returned.

    bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the data

    edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
            selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
