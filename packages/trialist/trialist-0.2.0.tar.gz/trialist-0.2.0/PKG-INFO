## Introduction

Trialist is a library that manages and runs your experiments for you care-free.
It manages the experimental loop, logs, and sets checkpoints as well. If your
experiments are restarted, it will reload from the checkpoints set.

You can customize every part of the system:

* Key generation function: Determines how a sample is stored and found.
* Validation function: Determines if the experiment is valid. By default, all
experimental results are loaded without checks.

### Example

See the [demo](https://github.com/Yiannis128/trialist-python/blob/master/demo.ipynb) file.

## Installation

```console
pip install trialist
```
