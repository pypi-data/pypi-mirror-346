# Development

## Tests

Tests are run using PyTest. You can simply run this command to launch tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Documentation

High-level documentation is handled by [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). You can update the generated `USAGE.md` file using this command:

```bash
make docs
```

[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is also used to generate a clean web page for documentation, you can check out its rendering by launching:

```bash
pip install -e .[docs]
mkdocs serve
```

## Translations

Translations and internationalization are managed with Python `gettext`. Translations files are located in `geopic_tag_reader/geopic_tag_reader/translations/` folder. You can make a string in code translated using:

```python
# Load i18n module
from geopic_tag_reader.i18n import init as i18n_init

# Create translator with appropriate language
_ = i18n_init("fr")

# Use _ function to translate
print(_("My label is {mood}").format(mood="good"))
```

Once you have done all your translations, run this command to update the POT label catalog (you will need to have the [`gettext` utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) installed):

```bash
make i18n-code2pot
```

Then, our translations are managed through [our Weblate instance](https://weblate.panoramax.xyz/).

If you want to convert translated PO files into MO files, you can run:

```bash
make i18n-po2code
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Note that before opening a pull requests, you may want to check formatting and tests of your changes:

```bash
make ci
```

You can also install git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to format code on commit with:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

### Add camera information

Many fallback information are made available through the `geopic_tag_reader/cameras.csv` file, which is structured this way:

- `make`: name of camera builder (as noted in `Make` EXIF field in picture)
- `model`: name of camera model (as noted in `Model` EXIF field in picture)
- `sensor_width`: the width of camera sensor (in millimeters)
- `is_360`: set to `1` if camera is a 360Â° device, left empty or set to `0` otherwise
- `gps_accuracy`: average GPS accuracy (in meters) if the camera has an embed GPS and pictures don't contain GPS horizontal positioning error in their metadata

If a camera is missing in this list, feel free to offer a pull request or send us these information through an issue or an email so we can expand the list.

Also note that more generic information about GPS accuracy from various camera brands is present in `geopic_tag_reader/camera.py` file (`GPS_ACCURACY_MAKE` constant). This allows us to say _"all smartphones from this brand have this GPS accuracy"_, feel free to contact us if we missed some brands.

## Make a release

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull

vim CHANGELOG.md					# Edit version + links at bottom
vim geopic_tag_reader/__init__.py	# Edit version
make prepare_release

git add *
git commit -m "Release x.x.x"
git tag -a x.x.x -m "Release x.x.x"
git push origin develop
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main --tags
```
