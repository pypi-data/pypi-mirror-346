## üîç Detailed Usage

### Scanning Text

To scan and annotate text for PII entities:

```bash
datafog scan-text "Your text here"
```

**Example:**

```bash
datafog scan-text "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
```

### Scanning Images

To extract text from images and optionally perform PII annotation:

```bash
datafog scan-image "path/to/image.png" --operations extract
```

**Example:**

```bash
datafog scan-image "nokia-statement.png" --operations extract
```

To extract text and annotate PII:

```bash
datafog scan-image "nokia-statement.png" --operations scan
```

### Redacting Text

To redact PII in text:

```bash
datafog redact-text "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
```

which should output:

```bash
[REDACTED] is the CEO of [REDACTED] and is based out of [REDACTED], [REDACTED]
```

### Replacing Text

To replace detected PII:

```bash
datafog replace-text "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
```

which should return something like:

```bash
[PERSON_B86CACE6] is the CEO of [UNKNOWN_445944D7] and is based out of [UNKNOWN_32BA5DCA], [UNKNOWN_B7DF4969]
```

Note: a unique randomly generated identifier is created for each detected entity

### Hashing Text

You can select from SHA256, SHA3-256, and MD5 hashing algorithms to hash detected PII. Currently the hashed output does not match the length of the original entity, for privacy-preserving purposes. The default is SHA256.

```bash
datafog hash-text "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
```

generating an output which looks like this:

```bash
5738a37f0af81594b8a8fd677e31b5e2cabd6d7791c89b9f0a1c233bb563ae39 is the CEO of f223faa96f22916294922b171a2696d868fd1f9129302eb41a45b2a2ea2ebbfd and is based out of ab5f41f04096cf7cd314357c4be26993eeebc0c094ca668506020017c35b7a9c, cad0535decc38b248b40e7aef9a1cfd91ce386fa5c46f05ea622649e7faf18fb
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- For `scan-image` and `scan-text` commands, use `--operations` to specify different operations. Default is `scan`.
- Process multiple images or text strings in a single command by providing multiple arguments.
- Ensure proper permissions and configuration of the DataFog service before running commands.

---

üí° **Tip:** For more detailed information on each command, use the `--help` option, e.g., `datafog scan-text --help`.

# Python SDK

## Getting Started

To use DataFog, you'll need to create a DataFog client with the desired operations. Here's a basic setup:

```python
from datafog import DataFog

# For text annotation
client = DataFog(operations="scan")

# For OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
ocr_client = DataFog(operations="extract")
```

## Engine Selection

DataFog now supports multiple annotation engines through the `TextService` class. You can choose between different engines for PII detection:

```python
from datafog.services.text_service import TextService

# Use regex engine only (fastest, pattern-based detection)
regex_service = TextService(engine="regex")

# Use spaCy engine only (more comprehensive NLP-based detection)
spacy_service = TextService(engine="spacy")

# Use auto mode (default) - tries regex first, falls back to spaCy if no entities found
auto_service = TextService()  # engine="auto" is the default
```

Each engine has different strengths:

- **regex**: Fast pattern matching, good for structured data like emails, phone numbers, credit cards, etc.
- **spacy**: NLP-based entity recognition, better for detecting names, organizations, locations, etc.
- **auto**: Best of both worlds - uses regex for speed, falls back to spaCy for comprehensive detection

## Text PII Annotation

Here's an example of how to annotate PII in a text document:

```
import requests

# Fetch sample medical record
doc_url = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sidmohan0/b43b72693226422bac5f083c941ecfdb/raw/b819affb51796204d59987893f89dee18428ed5d/note1.txt"
response = requests.get(doc_url)
text_lines = [line for line in response.text.splitlines() if line.strip()]

# Run annotation
annotations = client.run_text_pipeline_sync(str_list=text_lines)
print(annotations)
```

## OCR PII Annotation

For OCR capabilities, you can use the following:

```
import asyncio
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()


async def run_ocr_pipeline_demo():
    image_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/dc377004-1c2d-49f2-8ddf-d63f11c8d9c2.png"
    results = await ocr_client.run_ocr_pipeline(image_urls=[image_url])
    print("OCR Pipeline Results:", results)


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(run_ocr_pipeline_demo())
```

Note: The DataFog library uses asynchronous programming for OCR, so make sure to use the `async`/`await` syntax when calling the appropriate methods.

## Text Anonymization

DataFog provides various anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information. Here are examples of how to use them:

### Redacting Text

To redact PII in text:

```python
from datafog import DataFog
from datafog.config import OperationType

client = DataFog(operations=[OperationType.SCAN, OperationType.REDACT])

text = "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
redacted_text = client.run_text_pipeline_sync([text])[0]
print(redacted_text)
```

Output:

```
[REDACTED] is the CEO of [REDACTED] and is based out of [REDACTED], [REDACTED]
```

### Replacing Text

To replace detected PII with unique identifiers:

```python
from datafog import DataFog
from datafog.config import OperationType

client = DataFog(operations=[OperationType.SCAN, OperationType.REPLACE])

text = "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
replaced_text = client.run_text_pipeline_sync([text])[0]
print(replaced_text)
```

Output:

```
[PERSON_B86CACE6] is the CEO of [UNKNOWN_445944D7] and is based out of [UNKNOWN_32BA5DCA], [UNKNOWN_B7DF4969]
```

### Hashing Text

To hash detected PII:

```python
from datafog import DataFog
from datafog.config import OperationType
from datafog.models.anonymizer import HashType

client = DataFog(operations=[OperationType.SCAN, OperationType.HASH], hash_type=HashType.SHA256)

text = "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and is based out of Cupertino, California"
hashed_text = client.run_text_pipeline_sync([text])[0]
print(hashed_text)
```

Output:

```
5738a37f0af81594b8a8fd677e31b5e2cabd6d7791c89b9f0a1c233bb563ae39 is the CEO of f223faa96f22916294922b171a2696d868fd1f9129302eb41a45b2a2ea2ebbfd and is based out of ab5f41f04096cf7cd314357c4be26993eeebc0c094ca668506020017c35b7a9c, cad0535decc38b248b40e7aef9a1cfd91ce386fa5c46f05ea622649e7faf18fb
```

You can choose from SHA256 (default), SHA3-256, and MD5 hashing algorithms by specifying the `hash_type` parameter

## Performance

DataFog provides multiple annotation engines with different performance characteristics:

### Engine Selection

The `TextService` class supports three engine modes:

```python
# Use regex engine only (fastest, pattern-based detection)
regex_service = TextService(engine="regex")

# Use spaCy engine only (more comprehensive NLP-based detection)
spacy_service = TextService(engine="spacy")

# Use auto mode (default) - tries regex first, falls back to spaCy if no entities found
auto_service = TextService()  # engine="auto" is the default
```

### Performance Comparison

Benchmark tests show that the regex engine is significantly faster than spaCy for PII detection:

| Engine | Processing Time (10KB text) | Entities Detected                                    |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Regex  | ~0.004 seconds              | EMAIL, PHONE, SSN, CREDIT_CARD, IP_ADDRESS, DOB, ZIP |
| SpaCy  | ~0.48 seconds               | PERSON, ORG, GPE, CARDINAL, FAC                      |
| Auto   | ~0.004 seconds              | Same as regex when patterns are found                |

**Key findings:**

- The regex engine is approximately **123x faster** than spaCy for processing the same text
- The auto engine provides the best balance between speed and comprehensiveness
  - Uses fast regex patterns first
  - Falls back to spaCy only when no regex patterns are matched

### When to Use Each Engine

- **Regex Engine**: Use when processing large volumes of text or when performance is critical
- **SpaCy Engine**: Use when you need to detect a wider range of named entities beyond structured PII
- **Auto Engine**: Recommended for most use cases as it combines the speed of regex with the capability to fall back to spaCy when needed

### When do I need spaCy?

While the regex engine is significantly faster (123x faster in our benchmarks), there are specific scenarios where you might want to use spaCy:

1. **Complex entity recognition**: When you need to identify entities not covered by regex patterns, such as organization names, locations, or product names that don't follow predictable formats.

2. **Context-aware detection**: When the meaning of text depends on surrounding context that regex cannot easily capture, such as distinguishing between a person's name and a company with the same name based on context.

3. **Multi-language support**: When processing text in languages other than English where regex patterns might be insufficient or need significant customization.

4. **Research and exploration**: When experimenting with NLP capabilities and need the full power of a dedicated NLP library with features like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc.

5. **Unknown entity types**: When you don't know in advance what types of entities might be present in your text and need a more general-purpose entity recognition approach.

For high-performance production systems processing large volumes of text with known entity types (emails, phone numbers, credit cards, etc.), the regex engine is strongly recommended due to its significant speed advantage.

### Running Benchmarks Locally

You can run the performance benchmarks locally using pytest-benchmark:

```bash
pip install pytest-benchmark
pytest tests/benchmark_text_service.py -v
```

## Examples

For more detailed examples, check out our Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory:

- `text_annotation_example.ipynb`: Demonstrates text PII annotation
- `image_processing.ipynb`: Shows OCR capabilities and text extraction from images

These notebooks provide step-by-step guides on how to use DataFog for various tasks.

### Dev Notes

For local development:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd datafog-python
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment (using `.venv` is recommended as it is hardcoded in the justfile):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
6. Set up the project:
   ```
   just setup
   ```

Now, you can develop and run the project locally.

#### Important Actions:

- **Format the code**:
  ```
  just format
  ```
  This runs `isort` to sort imports.
- **Lint the code**:
  ```
  just lint
  ```
  This runs `flake8` to check for linting errors.
- **Generate coverage report**:
  ```
  just coverage-html
  ```
  This runs `pytest` and generates a coverage report in the `htmlcov/` directory.

We use [pre-commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elagil.pre-commit-helper) to run checks locally before committing changes. Once installed, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Dependencies

For OCR, we use Tesseract, which is incorporated into the build step. You can find the relevant configurations under `.github/workflows/` in the following files:

- `dev-cicd.yml`
- `feature-cicd.yml`
- `main-cicd.yml`
