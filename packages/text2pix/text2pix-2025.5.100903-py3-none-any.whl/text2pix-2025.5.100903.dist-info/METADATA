# Text2Pix

`Text2Pix` is an innovative Python package that generates images based on textual descriptions. It leverages advanced image generation APIs to transform descriptive text into visual representations.

## Installation

To install `Text2Pix`, use pip:

```bash
pip install text2pix
```

## Usage

Using `Text2Pix` is straightforward. Here's a simple example:

```python
from text2pix import generate_image_from_text

text_description = "A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset."
image_content = generate_image_from_text(text_description)

# Save or display the image content as needed.
# for example, to save the image to a file:
with open('lake.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(image_content)
```

The result will be an image file named `lake.png` that visually represents the text description.
