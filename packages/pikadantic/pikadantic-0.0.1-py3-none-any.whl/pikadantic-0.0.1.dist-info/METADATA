# Pikadantic

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**Pikadantic** is a Python library that integrates [Pika](https://github.com/pika/pika/tree/main/pika) with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to provide robust data validation for RabbitMQ messaging.

## 🚀 Why Pikadantic?

* **Seamless Integration**: Combines Pika's messaging capabilities with Pydantic's data validation.
* **Type Safety**: Leverages Python's type hints for clear and enforceable message schemas.
* **Data Integrity**: Validates messages before sending or processing, reducing runtime errors.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install pikadantic
```
