class BaseCluster:
    """
    A base class for managing Redis clusters with flexible prefix-based key 
    management, subcluster support, and runtime parameter inheritance.

    This class facilitates the creation of Redis clusters by:
    - Defining a customizable key prefix using the `__prefix__` attribute.
    - Allowing TTL (Time-to-Live) settings for keys, configurable at both 
        the cluster and key levels.
    - Validating parameter types through custom validators.
    - Supporting hierarchical subclusters for organized data management.
    - Efficiently caching the computed cluster prefix to reduce redundant calculations.
    - Providing utility methods to clear or fetch keys associated with the cluster.

    Attributes:
        __prefix__ (str): The prefix string applied to all keys within the cluster.
        __ttl__ (int or None): Default TTL (in seconds) applied to keys, or `None` for no expiration.
        ENABLE_CACHING (bool): Whether caching of computed prefixes is enabled (default is `True`).
        redis (Any): Redis client used to interact with the Redis server.
        _inherited_params (dict): Parameters inherited from the parent cluster.
        _parent (BaseCluster or None): The parent cluster, if this cluster is a subcluster.

    Methods:
        get_full_prefix(): Computes and returns the full prefix for the cluster, including parent prefixes.
        with_params(**params): Creates a new instance of the cluster with additional parameters.
        describe(): Returns a dictionary description of the cluster, including its prefix, parameters, subclusters, and keys.
        clear(): Deletes all keys under the cluster by scanning with the cluster prefix.
        subkeys(): Returns all keys under the cluster by scanning with the cluster prefix.

        Initializes a new instance of the BaseCluster class with the specified Redis client, inherited parameters, 
        and an optional parent cluster.

        This constructor sets up the cluster by applying validators to the provided parameters, 
        binding any subclusters, and collecting runtime information. It also assigns the Redis client 
        and prepares the cluster's representation for documentation.

        Args:
            redis_client (Any, optional): The Redis client to use for interacting with the Redis server. 
                                        If not provided, will use the Redis client from the parent cluster if available.
            inherited_params (dict, optional): A dictionary of parameters inherited from the parent cluster. 
                                            Defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided.
            _parent (BaseCluster, optional): The parent cluster, from which inherited parameters and Redis client 
                                            can be fetched. Defaults to `None`.

        Raises:
            ParameterValidationError: If any of the parameters fail validation based on the cluster's validators.

        Side Effects:
            - Applies parameter validators to ensure that inherited parameters meet required constraints.
            - Binds subclusters defined within the cluster's class.
            - Caches the cluster's documentation string by calling `get_pretty_representation()` on the description.
