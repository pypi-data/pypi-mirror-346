    `PERCENTILE`     This strategy determines chunk boundaries by identifying points where the semantic distance between adjacent text segments exceeds a specified threshold, as determined by percentile ranking.     By targeting the top X% of distance values (e.g., the highest 5%), it effectively locates areas of significant content shift.<br>     - **Strength:** Captures the most significant semantic shifts, regardless of data distribution.<br>     - **Limitation:** Sensitive to noise in highly variable datasets.<br>     - **Suitable For:** Documents with clear, abrupt topic changes (e.g., multi-section articles or FAQ documents).<br>     - **Use Case:** Customer Support Knowledge Base - In a large FAQ or troubleshooting guide, users often jump between unrelated sections. Percentile chunking can identify sharp semantic breaks between independent questions or problem areas, ensuring each chunk is contextually isolated and retrievable.<br><br> `STANDARD_DEVIATION`     This strategy applies the statistical measure of standard deviation to identify chunk boundaries by analyzing variations in semantic distance between adjacent text segments.     By detecting when the distance between segments significantly deviates from the average, it highlights points that may indicate meaningful transitions.<br>      - **Strength:** Detects statistically rare deviations in otherwise consistent text.<br>      - **Limitation:** Ineffective in skewed or uniformly distributed data.<br>      - **Suitable For:**  Domain-specific content with regular structure and occasional major transitions (e.g., regulatory documents).<br>      - **Use Case:** Legal or Compliance Documents - Policies, contracts, or regulatory texts typically contain uniform structure and language but occasionally include clauses or exceptions with significantly different content. Standard deviation effectively detects these rare deviations while ignoring regular variations.<br><br> `INTERQUARTILE`     The strategy identifies chunk boundaries by analyzing distance values in relation to the interquartile range (IQR), which is the spread between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the distance data.     By focusing on distances that fall beyond the upper or lower quartiles, it highlights boundaries where the content transitions noticeably.<br>     - **Strength:** Resilient to outliers and non-normal distributions.<br>     - **Limitation:** Less sensitive to smaller but important transitions within the interquartile band.<br>     - **Suitable For:**  Noisy text with occasional sharp transitions, such as scraped or user-generated content.<br>     - **Use Case:** User Reviews or Survey Responses - User-generated content tends to have inconsistent structure and noise. IQR-based chunking can isolate meaningful shifts in sentiment or subject without being influenced by extreme or irrelevant responses, especially when processing large review datasets.<br><br> `GRADIENT`     This strategy uses the gradient of similarity scores, combined with the percentile approach, to determine chunk boundaries.     The technique applies anomaly detection to the gradient values, helping to widen the distribution and make semantic boundaries easier to detect.<br>     - **Strength:** Detects subtle and evolving topic changes in smooth transitions.<br>     - **Limitation:** May miss abrupt shifts if not preceded by gradual change.<br>     - **Suitable For:** Narratives, long instructions, or technical walkthroughs with gradual topic evolution.<br>     - **Use Case:** Instructional Manuals or Technical Tutorials - In step-by-step guides or onboarding materials, each section may gradually build on the last. Gradient-based chunking captures the smooth semantic flow, identifying logical transitions between phases of explanation or user guidance.
